insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('The work presented here has as its main challenge the ability to control the maximum absolute error (MAE), which is also known as the L infinity metric, when compressing scientific data sets using JPEG 2000 Part 2 and residual coding. The residuals are compressed using JPEG 2000 Part 1 by bypassing the wavelet transform, which means that only the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is used. In addition to controlling the MAE, techniques that minimize the MAE when a bit rate is specified are also described and tested. The proposed algorithms use JPEG 2000 for both, lossy compression of the original data and lossless residual coding. Due to the use of these two compression steps, the overall compression (total bit rate) is a function of two variables, the lossy bit rate and the lossless residual bit rate. For the case of controlling the MAE, two methods that search for the lowest total bit rate based on information obtained at two pivot points (lossy bit rates) are proposed. The results obtained using these techniques are compared with those acquired utilizing an exhaustive search. It will be shown that the pivot-based algorithms yield similar results obtained by using the exhaustive search. For the case of minimizing the MAE when a bit rate is specified, two techniques are developed and tested. The use of the JPEG 2000 quality scalability property is analyzed with regards to solving this same problem. This technique requires some form of bit allocation for the case of 3D data sets. Analysis and results for the methods that minimize the MAE are also included. It will be demonstrated that JPEG 2000 can be used to control the maximum absolute error using model-based techniques that omit the use of an exhaustive search. The main idea behind this work is that the MAE can be controlled under the JPEG 2000 compression framework.

This is not a love story. If it were, we would have the same story. But he has his, and I have mine. In 1916, Georgia O’Keeffe is a young, unknown art teacher when she travels to New York to meet Stieglitz, the famed photographer and art dealer, who has discovered O’Keeffe’s work and exhibits it in his gallery. Their connection is instantaneous. O’Keeffe is quickly drawn into Stieglitz’s sophisticated world, becoming his mistress, protégé, and muse, as their attraction deepens into an intense and tempestuous relationship and his photographs of her, both clothed and nude, create a sensation. Yet as her own creative force develops, Georgia begins to push back against what critics and others are saying about her and her art. And soon she must make difficult choices to live a life she believes in. A breathtaking work of the imagination, Georgia is the story of a passionate young woman, her search for love and artistic freedom, the sacrifices she will face, and the bold vision that will make her a legend. Praise for Georgia “Complex and original . . . Georgia conveys O’Keeffe’s joys and disappointments, rendering both the woman and the artist with keenness and consideration.”—The New York Times Book Review “As magical and provocative as O’Keeffe’s lush paintings of flowers that upended the art world in the 1920s . . . Tripp inhabits Georgia’s psyche so deeply that the reader can practically feel the paintbrush in hand as she creates her abstract paintings and New Mexico landscapes. . . . Evocative from the first page to the last, Tripp’s Georgia is a romantic yet realistic exploration of the sacrifices one of the foremost artists of the twentieth century made for love.”—USA Today “Sexually charged . . . insightful . . . Dawn Tripp humanizes an artist who is seen in biographies as more icon than woman. Her sensuous novel is as finely rendered as an O’Keeffe painting.”—The Denver Post “A vivid work forged from the actual events of O’Keeffe’s life . . . [Tripp] imbues the novel with a protagonist who forces the reader to consider the breadth of O’Keeffe’s talent, business savvy, courage and wanderlust. . . . [She] is vividly alive as she grapples with success, fame, integrity, love and family.”—Salon “Masterful . . . The book is a lovely portrayal of an iconic artist who is independent and multidimensional. Tripp’s O’Keeffe is a woman hoping to break free of conventional definitions of art, life and gender, as well as a woman of deep passion and love.”—Milwaukee Journal Sentinel “O’Keeffe blazes across the pages in Tripp’s tour de force about this indomitable woman. . . . Tripp has hit her stride here, bringing to life one of the most remarkable artists of the twentieth century with veracity, heart, and panache.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “I devoured this dazzling novel about an American icon.

Beginning with the first intimations of the existence of Georgians in ancient Anatolia and ending with today’s volatile President Saakashvili, Rayfield deals with the country’s internal politics and swings between disintegration and unity, and divulges Georgia’s complex struggles with the empires that have tried to control, fragment, or even destroy it. He describes the country’s conflicts with Xenophon’s Greeks, Arabs, invading Turks, the Crusades, Genghis Khan, the Persian Empire, the Russian Empire, and Soviet totalitarianism. A wide-ranging examination of this small but colorful country, its dramatic state-building, and its tragic political mistakes, Edge of Empires draws our eyes to this often overlooked nation.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PxQpmg_JIpwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Edge of Empires');

In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie’ s special and widely hailed literary mastery.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LUSXbXK-Ue8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Castles of Steel');

Mott summarized his basic ideas on the subject in his wonderful book Metal--Insulator nansitions that first appeared in 1974 11. 1). In his view, a Motk insulator displays a gap for charge-carrying excitations due to electron cowelations, whose importance is expressed by the presence of local magnetic moments regardless of whether or not they are ordered. Since the subject is far from being settled, different opinions on specific aspects of the Mott transition still persist. This book naturally embodies my own understanding of the phenomenon, inspired by the work of the late Sir Kevill Mott. The purpose of this book is twofold: first, to give a detailed presen- tion of the basic theoretical concopts for Mott insulators and, second, to test these ideas against the results from model calculations. For this purpose the Hubbard model and some of its derivatives are best suited. The Hubbard model describes a Mott transition with a mere minimum of tunable par- eters, and various exact statements and even exact solutions exist in certain limiting cases. Exact solutions not only allow us to test our basic ideas, but also help to assess the quality of approxin~ate theories for correlated electron systems.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uCPgHgEKnwEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Mott Metal-Insulator Transition');

Given uncertainty about the adequacy of existing safety regulations, the moratorium provided time to determine whether and how deepwater drilling could continue in a safe and environmentally-sound manner. The moratorium was in effect until November 30, 2010. This report estimates the economic consequences of this moratorium in the 5 Gulf Coast states. Illustrations.

Addressing how the Ministry of Justice in Japan justified capital punishment policy during the de facto moratorium periods from 1989 to 1993, from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2012, the author debates the misconceptions surrounding the significance of these moratoriums. The book evidences the approach, rationale and evolution of Japan’s Ministry of Justice in consistently justifying capital punishment policy during the different execution-free periods and provides a better understanding of the powerful unelected elite who actually drive the capital punishment system in Japan. Based on parliamentary proceedings, public opinion surveys and periodical reports by both international and domestic human rights NGOs as well as interviews of government ministers, NGO staff, pro- and anti-death-penalty advocates, this text is key reading for those interested in Japan, its government, criminal justice system and policies on the death penalty and human rights.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YRg9DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Japanese Moratorium on the Death Penalty');

The cry from a majority of stakeholders is a desperate plea to enforce the death penalty which has been derogated by the courts, at home and abroad. The abatement of capital punishment takes place amidst a tidal wave of unrelenting crimes against the person, namely murder. The branches of government seem bereft at best to provide a remedy and at worse unable to enforce the law as it relates capital punishment in the Bahamas. Added to this is an uneasy public whose trust in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government is noticeably waning. Additionally, outside forces, led by abolitionists, are bearing down on the Bahamas with a view of nudging the nation and the Caribbean into an era of life imprisonment for murder as opposed to death by hanging as its penalty. Toote sets forth these issues with striking clarity, offering practical remedies to help settle the controversy surrounding the death penalty in the Bahamas and the Caribbean.

In the past, a revolution in production, such as the industrial revolution, generally increased the wealth and freedom of people. The digital revolution we are living through is different. Instead of leaving a greater number of us in excellent financial health, the effect of digital technologies - and the companies behind them - is to concentrate wealth, reduce growth, and challenge the livelihoods of an ever-increasing number of people. As the protections of the middle class disappear, washed away by crises in capitalism, what is being left in their place? And what else could replace them? Why is this happening, and what might we do about it? In Who Owns the Future? Jaron Lanier shows how the new power paradigm operates, how it is conceived and controlled, and why it is leading to a collapse in living standards. Arguing that the ''information economy'' ruins markets, he reminds us that markets should reward more people, not fewer. He shows us why the digital revolution means more corporations making money and avoiding risk by hiding value off their books, which means more financial risk for the rest of us. From the inner workings of the ''sirenic servers'' at the heart of the new power system, to an exploration of the meaning of mass unemployment events, the misuse of big data, and the deep and increasing erasure of human endeavour, Lanier explores the effects of this situation on democracy and individuals, and proposes a more human, humane reality, where risk and reward is shared equally, and the digital revolution creates opportunity for all. Praise for You Are Not a Gadget: ''Fabulous - I couldn''t put it down and shouted out Yes! Yes! on many pages ... a landmark book that will have people talking and arguing for years into the future'' Lee Smolin ''A provocative and sure-to-be-controversial book . . . Lucid, powerful and persuasive'' The New York Times ''Short and frightening ... from a position of real knowledge and insight'' Zadie Smith Jaron Lanier is a philosopher and computer scientist who has spent his career pushing the transformative power of modern technology to its limits. From coining the term ''Virtual Reality'' to developing cutting-edge medical imaging and surgical techniques, Lanier is one of the premier designers and engineers at work today, and is linked with UC Berkeley and Microsoft. A musician with a collection of over 700 instruments, he has been recognised by Encyclopedia Britannica (but certainly not Wikipedia) as one of history''s 300 or so greatest inventors and named one of the top one hundred public intellectuals in the world by Prospect and Foreign Policy.

In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku—the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible—gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world’s top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics. In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world''s information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism. Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically. In space, radically new ships—needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion—could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth’s atmosphere at the push of a button. But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper? All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

While Alec Ross was working as Hillary Clinton''s Senior Advisor on Innovation, he traveled to forty-one countries. He visited some of the toughest places in the world—from refugee camps of Congo to Syrian war zones. From phone-charger stands in Rwanda to R&D labs in South Korea, Ross has seen what the future holds. Over the past two decades, the Internet has radically changed markets and businesses worldwide. InThe Industries of the Future, Ross shows us what''s next, highlighting the best opportunities for progress and explaining why countries thrive or sputter. He examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future over the next ten years, including cybercrime and cybersecurity, the commercialization of genomics, the next step for big data, and the coming impact of digital technology on money, payments, and markets. And in each of these realms, Ross addresses the toughest questions: How will we have to adapt to the changing nature of work? Is the prospect of cyberwar sparking the next arms race? How can the world''s rising nations hope to match Silicon Valley in creating their own innovation hotspots? Ross blends storytelling and economic analysis to give a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, incorporating the insights of leaders ranging from the founders of Google and Twitter to defense experts like David Petraeus. The Industries of the Future takes the intimidating, complex topics that many of us know to be important and boils them down into clear, plain-spoken language.

By examining the role of the cheesemaker throughout world history and by understanding a few basic principles of cheese science and technology, we can see how different cheeses have been shaped by and tailored to their surrounding environment, as well as defined by their social and cultural context. Cheese and Culture endeavors to advance our appreciation of cheese origins by viewing human history through the eyes of a cheese scientist. There is also a larger story to be told, a grand narrative that binds all cheeses together into a single history that started with the discovery of cheese making and that is still unfolding to this day. This book reconstructs that 9000-year story based on the often fragmentary information that we have available. Cheese and Culture embarks on a journey that begins in the Neolithic Age and winds its way through the ensuing centuries to the present. This tour through cheese history intersects with some of the pivotal periods in human prehistory and ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and modern history that have shaped western civilization, for these periods also shaped the lives of cheesemakers and the diverse cheeses that they developed. The book offers a useful lens through which to view our twenty-first century attitudes toward cheese that we have inherited from our past, and our attitudes about the food system more broadly.

Heather Paxson''s engaging stories are as rich, sharp, and well-grounded as the product she scrutinizes. A must read for anyone interested in fostering a sustainable food system." Warren Belasco, author of Meals to Come: A History of the Future of Food "Heather Paxson''s lucid and engaging book, The Life of Cheese, is a gift to anyone interested in exploring the wonderful and wonderfully complex realities of artisan cheesemaking in the United States. Paxson deftly integrates careful considerations of the importance of sentiment, value and craft to the work of cheesemakers with vivid stories and lush descriptions of their farms, cheese plants and cheese caves. While she beguiles you with the stories and tastes of cheeses from Vermont, Wisconsin and California, she also asks you to envision a post-pastoral ethos in the making. This ethos reconsiders contemporary beliefs about America''s food commerce and culture, reimagines our relationship to the natural world, and redefines how we make, eat, and appreciate food. For cheese aficionados, food activists, anthropologists and food scholars alike, reading The Life of Cheese will be a transformative experience."

There are an increasing number of books on the market about making cheese, but none approaches the intricacies of cheesemaking science alongside considerations for preparing each type of cheese variety in as much detail as Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking. Indeed, this book fills a big hole in the market. Beginner guides leave you wanting more content and explanation of process, while recipe-based cookbooks often fail to dig deeper into the science, and therefore don’t allow for a truly intuitive cheesemaker to develop. Acclaimed cheesemaker Gianaclis Caldwell has written the book she wishes existed when she was starting out. Every serious home-scale artisan cheesemaker—even those just beginning to experiment—will want this book as their bible to take them from their first quick mozzarella to a French mimolette, and ultimately to designing their own unique cheeses. This comprehensive and user-friendly guide thoroughly explains the art and science that allow milk to be transformed into epicurean masterpieces. Caldwell offers a deep look at the history, science, culture, and art of making artisan cheese on a small scale, and includes detailed information on equipment and setting up a home-scale operation. A large part of the book includes extensive process-based recipes dictating not only the hard numbers, but also the concepts behind each style of cheese and everything you want to know about affinage (aging) and using oils, brushes, waxes, infusions, and other creative aging and flavoring techniques. Also included are beautiful photographs, profiles of other cheesemakers, and in-depth appendices for quick reference in the preparation and aging room. Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking will also prove an invaluable resource for those with, or thinking of starting, a small-scale creamery. Let Gianaclis Caldwell be your mentor, guide, and cheering section as you follow the pathway to a mastery of cheesemaking.

The uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) metal centers in these materials showed an affinity towards binding with the ligand in a bidentate fashion through a carboxylate oxygen atom and nitrogen from a heterocyclic aromatic forming a 5-membered ring. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the uranium based coordination polymers were investigated. The fluorescence of hexavalent uranium in both solution and the solid state is known to derive from vibronic transitions of the central uranyl moiety, UO22+. Upon excitation of the uranyl cation, the characteristic emission between 450-600 nm results from the symmetric stretching of the O=U bond with known vibronic frequency of 860 cm-1. The frequencies for the homometallic materials were calculated to range from 862-894 cm-1 agreeing with the literature value of 860 cm-1. The pyridinedicarboxylic acid series illustrated a fascinating feature in the emission spectra: shoulder peaks. Attempts to correlate the shoulder peaks with the geometric nature of the uranyl cation in each compound are presented herein. When the uranyl cation was excited in the heterometallic compounds within the 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid systems, the characteristic emission was not detected. This observation indicates that the copper (II) metal centers may provide an alternative pathway for non-radiative decay. In compound 13, the copper and uranium metal centers are bridged through a uranyl oxygen atom. This change in the uranyl environment may also contribute to the lack of detectable uranyl emission. Conversely, uranyl emission was observed when either copper (II) or lead (II) was incorporated into the uranium-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid system (compounds 8 and 11). This occurrence may be the first instance where uranyl emission was observed in the presence of a transition metal in the solid state. These photophysical properties along with the structural schematics of the various systems will be discussed.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGKeGhZfzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Controlling the Hydrothermal Conditions to Synthesize Novel Uranium-based Heterometallic Coordination Polymers and Their Subsequent Fluorescence Investigations');

Furthermore magnetic measurements have shown that the coupling between the thin NiO and CoO layers causes the growth of a new anisotropy that in turn enhances the exchange coupling between Ni and NiO resulting in larger HEB (778Oe at 5K) as compared to a similar Ni/NiO (80Oe at 5K) structure.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fUyOmT-ievEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Core/shell Structured Magnetic Nanoparticles Synthesized by Inert Gas Condensation');

Human activity and occupation in the area over the course of 6000 years have left indelible marks on the countryside which are clearly visible from the air. Stone Age tracks and earthworks, Iron Age camps and medieval manor houses, modern buildings and sprawling towns with their factories and suburbs, railways and roads can all be seen in this survey with a new clarity and understanding. The book begins with the traces of the ditches and barrows made by the earliest inhabitants. It then takes the reader through Roman and Saxon times to the Middle Ages and on to the visible remains of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It vividly records the impact of the industrial revolution and the rapid developments of the nineteenth century, and the final chapters show the motorways, housing estates, city centres and golf courses of the twentieth century. The photographs, which have been chosen from the Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs, cover the full range of sites that can be found in the county. Famous monuments are included - Ely Cathedral, Cambridge colleges and Wimpole Hall - and so are rare but no less intriguing places like burial mounds and forts, abandoned villages and medieval fields. The book also shows parish churches and village greens, canals and gardens and the orderly patterns of modern suburbs and towns.

The familiar Socratic conceit from the Phaedrus, of communication as the process of writing directly on the soul of the other, has returned to center stage in today''s discussions of culture and media. Indeed Western thought has long construed media as a grand choice between two kinds of interfaces. Following the optimistic path, media seamlessly interface self and other in a transparent and immediate connection. But, following the pessimistic path, media are the obstacles to direct communion, disintegrating self and other into misunderstanding and contradiction. In other words, media interfaces are either clear or complicated, either beautiful or deceptive, either already known or endlessly interpretable. Recognizing the limits of either path, Galloway charts an alternative course by considering the interface as an autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its own ends: the interface effect. Rather than praising user-friendly interfaces that work well, or castigating those that work poorly, this book considers the unworkable nature of all interfaces, from windows and doors to screens and keyboards. Considered allegorically, such thresholds do not so much tell the story of their own operations but beckon outward into the realm of social and political life, and in so doing ask a question to which the political interpretation of interfaces is the only coherent answer. Grounded in philosophy and cultural theory and driven by close readings of video games, software, television, painting, and other images, Galloway seeks to explain the logic of digital culture through an analysis of its most emblematic and ubiquitous manifestation – the interface.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2c_o4M5-x6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Interface Effect');

It vividly records the impact of the industrial revolution and the rapid developments of the nineteenth century, and the final chapters show the motorways, housing estates, city centres and golf courses of the twentieth century.

Famous monuments are included - Ely Cathedral, Cambridge colleges and Wimpole Hall - and so are rare but no less intriguing places like burial mounds and forts, abandoned villages and medieval fields.

With the help of this system, users will be able to retrieve multimedia resources from digital libraries more efficiently than they would by browsing through an index or by using a simple keyword search. E-Librarian Services combine recent advances in multimedia information retrieval with aspects of human-machine interfaces, such as the ability to ask questions in natural language; they simulate a human librarian by finding and delivering the most relevant documents that offer users potential answers to their queries. The premise is that more pertinent results can be retrieved if the search engine understands the meaning of the query; the returned results are therefore logical consequences of an inference rather than of keyword matches. Moreover, E-Librarian Services always provide users with a solution, even in situations where they are unable to offer a comprehensive answer.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=81rtxgnq4F4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'E-Librarian Service');

When an extra-terrestrial visitor arrives on Earth, his first impressions of the human species are less than positive. Taking the form of Professor Andrew Martin, a prominent mathematician at Cambridge University, the visitor is eager to complete the gruesome task assigned him and hurry home to his own utopian planet, where everyone is omniscient and immortal. He is disgusted by the way humans look, what they eat, their capacity for murder and war, and is equally baffled by the concepts of love and family. But as time goes on, he starts to realize there may be more to this strange species than he had thought. Disguised as Martin, he drinks wine, reads poetry, develops an ear for rock music, and a taste for peanut butter. Slowly, unexpectedly, he forges bonds with Martin’s family. He begins to see hope and beauty in the humans’ imperfection, and begins to question the very mission that brought him there. Praised by The New York Times as a “novelist of great seriousness and talent,” author Matt Haig delivers an unlikely story about human nature and the joy found in the messiness of life on Earth.

Its starting point is the annual Turing Test, which pits artificial intelligence programs against people to determine if computers can “think.” Named for computer pioneer Alan Turing, the Tur­ing Test convenes a panel of judges who pose questions—ranging anywhere from celebrity gossip to moral conundrums—to hidden contestants in an attempt to discern which is human and which is a computer. The machine that most often fools the panel wins the Most Human Computer Award. But there is also a prize, bizarre and intriguing, for the Most Human Human. In 2008, the top AI program came short of passing the Turing Test by just one astonishing vote. In 2009, Brian Christian was chosen to participate, and he set out to make sure Homo sapiens would prevail. The author’s quest to be deemed more human than a com­puter opens a window onto our own nature. Interweaving modern phenomena like customer service “chatbots” and men using programmed dialogue to pick up women in bars with insights from fields as diverse as chess, psychiatry, and the law, Brian Christian examines the philosophical, bio­logical, and moral issues raised by the Turing Test. One central definition of human has been “a being that could reason.” If computers can reason, what does that mean for the special place we reserve for humanity?

Autism therapy typically focuses on ridding individuals of “autistic” symptoms such as difficulties interacting socially, problems in communicating, sensory challenges, and repetitive behavior patterns. Now Dr. Barry M. Prizant offers a new and compelling paradigm: the most successful approaches to autism don’t aim at fixing a person by eliminating symptoms, but rather seeking to understand the individual’s experience and what underlies the behavior. “A must-read for anyone touched by autism... Dr. Prizant’s Uniquely Human is a crucial step in promoting better understanding and a more humane approach” (Associated Press). Instead of classifying “autistic” behaviors as signs of pathology, Dr. Prizant sees them as part of a range of strategies to cope with a world that feels chaotic and overwhelming. Rather than curb these behaviors, it’s better to enhance abilities, build on strengths, and offer supports that will lead to more desirable behavior and a better quality of life. “A remarkable approach to autism....A truly impactful, necessary book” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), Uniquely Human offers inspiration and practical advice drawn from Dr. Prizant’s four-decade career. It conveys a deep respect for people with autism and their own unique qualities. Filled with humanity and wisdom, Uniquely Human “should reassure parents and caregivers of kids with autism and any other disability that their kids are not broken, but, indeed, special” (Booklist, starred review).', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EojBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Uniquely Human');

How do we establish the content of particular human rights, and how do we resolve conflicts between them? These are pressing questions for philosophers, political theorists, jurisprudents, international lawyers, and activists. James Griffin offers answers in his compelling new investigation of the foundations of human rights. First, On Human Rights traces the idea of a natural right from its origin in the late Middle Ages, when the rights were seen as deriving from natural laws, through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the original theological background was progressively dropped and ''natural law'' emptied of most of its original meaning. By the end of the Enlightenment, the term ''human rights'' (droits de l''homme) appeared, marking the purge of the theological background. But the Enlightenment, in putting nothing in its place, left us with an unsatisfactory, incomplete idea of a human right. Griffin shows how the language of human rights has become debased. There are scarcely any accepted criteria, either in the academic or the public sphere, for correct use of the term. He takes on the task of showing the way towards a determinate concept of human rights, based on their relation to the human status that we all share. He works from certain paradigm cases, such as freedom of expression and freedom of worship, to more disputed cases such as welfare rights - for instance the idea of a human right to health. His goal is a substantive account of human rights - an account with enough content to tell us whether proposed rights really are rights. Griffin emphasizes the practical as well as theoretical urgency of this goal: as the United Nations recognized in 1948 with its Universal Declaration, the idea of human rights has considerable power to improve the lot of humanity around the world. We can''t do without the idea of human rights, and we need to get clear about it. It is our job now - the job of this book - to influence and develop the unsettled discourse of human rights so as to complete the incomplete idea.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0KsipPg2Ta4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'On Human Rights');

Nick Zangwill investigates the nature of beauty as we conceive it, and as it is in itself. The notion of beauty is currently attracting increased interest, particularly in philosophical aesthetics and in discussions of our experiences and judgments about art. In The Metaphysics of Beauty, Zangwill argues that it is essential to beauty that it depends on the ordinary features of things. He uses this principle to defend the notion of the aesthetic, to call for a version of aesthetic formalism, and to reconsider the reality of beauty. The Metaphysics of Beauty brings beauty to the center of intellectual consciousness in a manner informed by contemporary metaphysics and engages with beauty as an enduring object of human thought and experience.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vp2c0LOPjB8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Metaphysics of Beauty');

Mears, who worked as a model in New York and London, draws on observations as well as extensive interviews with male and female models, agents, clients, photographers, stylists, and others, to explore the economics and politics—and the arbitrariness— behind the business of glamour. Exploring a largely hidden arena of cultural production, she shows how the right "look" is discovered, developed, and packaged to become a prized commodity.

This approach is based on the use of a family of Markov processes called Piecewise-Deterministic Processes (PDPs) as a general class of stochastic system models. A PDP is a Markov process that follows deterministic trajectories between random jumps, the latter occurring either spontaneously, in a Poisson-like fashion, or when the process hits the boundary of its state space. This formulation includes an enormous variety of applied problems in engineering, operations research, management science and economics as special cases; examples include queueing systems, stochastic scheduling, inventory control, resource allocation problems, optimal planning of production or exploitation of renewable or non-renewable resources, insurance analysis, fault detection in process systems, and tracking of maneuvering targets, among many others. The first part of the book shows how these applications lead to the PDP as a system model, and the main properties of PDPs are derived. There is particular emphasis on the so-called extended generator of the process, which gives a general method for calculating expectations and distributions of system performance functions. The second half of the book is devoted to control theory for PDPs, with a view to controlling PDP models for optimal performance: characterizations are obtained of optimal strategies both for continuously-acting controllers and for control by intervention (impulse control). Throughout the book, modern methods of stochastic analysis are used, but all the necessary theory is developed from scratch and presented in a self-contained way. The book will be useful to engineers and scientists in the application areas as well as to mathematicians interested in applications of stochastic analysis.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tUuRyn1XZeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Markov Models & Optimization');

The possibility for improvements may arise in any context, for example, in the control of a chemical plant, the organization of production to meet delivery dates, the design of rubber compounds, in traffic signal settings, and so on. In this volume, T. A. J. Nicholson deals with applications of the industrial optimization techniques demonstrated in the first volume of this two-part project, Optimization in Industry: Optimization Techniques. Applications are classified by their main functional areas in industrial planning, design, and control. The fields covered are machine sequencing, stock control and scheduling, plant renewal, distribution, financial problems, and chemical process control and design. These last two, in particular, are subjects often overlooked in operations research curricula. In each field the place and status of optimization techniques is first described and then a wide range of realistic case studies and examples are reviewed, many of them international. The problems given in this volume are primarily concerned with formulation not with solution; the task is to formulate the problems to be solved by one or more of the methods described in volume one. By connecting the optimization techniques with their applications, the gap between the people devising the methods and the people who actually need to use them is bridged.

Over time, credit ratings have gradually taken on an expanding role, both in the United States and abroad and in official financial market regulation as well as in private capital market decisions. However, in 1999 the Bank for International Settlements (through its Committee on Banking Supervision) proposed rule changes that would provide an explicit role for credit ratings in determining a bank''s required regulatory risk capital. Once implemented, this BIS proposal (often referred to as Basel 2) would vastly elevate the importance of credit ratings by linking the required measure of bank capital to the credit rating of the bank''s obligors. With these regulatory changes under active discussion, research into the role for ratings and rating agencies in the global financial system is particularly apropos. Ratings, Rating Agencies and the Global Financial System brings together the research of economists at New York University and the University of Maryland, along with those from the private sector, government bodies, and other universities. The first section of the volume focuses on the historical origins of the credit rating business and its present day industrial organization structure. The second section presents several empirical studies crafted largely around individual firm-level or bank-level data. These studies examine (a) the relationship between ratings and the default and recovery experience of corporate borrowers, (b) the comparability of credit ratings made by domestic and foreign rating agencies, and (c) the usefulness of financial market indicators for rating banks, among other topics. In the third section, the record of sovereign credit ratings in predicting financial crises and the reaction of financial markets to changes in credit ratings is examined. The final section of the volume emphasizes policy issues now facing regulators and credit rating agencies.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kk5cHKbYjkYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Ratings, Rating Agencies and the Global Financial System');

In SAP you can verify invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts. SAP provides important functionalities like automatic account determination, financial posting, etc. SAP is powerful software that can meet the needs of any business scenario for any type of business in any part of the world. Its all encompassing nature makes SAP complex. In order to derive maximum benefit for business, SAP must be understood well. Mr. Agrawal attempts to explain SAP completely; a seemingly impossible task. This is his third book on the Materials Management module; his first two books in the Materials Management module are ‘Purchasing’ and ‘Inventory Management’. In this book, like in his earlier books, he explains every screen of SAP MM Invoice Verification. Both the SAP Menu and Customizing Implementation Guide are expanded and the chapter number where they are covered is indicated. This not only creates a direct link between the book and the SAP software, but also ensures that the book is comprehensive. The author has taken care to balance details with overviews that explain linkages between concepts. The book is organized in chapters that are important business activities. Each chapter covers business processes carried out in SAP by the user as well as its related configuration. This book can be used to learn SAP from scratch; it is a learning guide. It is, therefore, useful to persons who are training to be SAP Consultants. Having learnt SAP with the help of this book, the Consultant keeps returning to refer to it. In implementation of SAP, Consultants prepare User Manual. With the availability of this book, their task becomes simpler. In the User Manual, they need to cover only implementation specific points. The user refers to this book as a generic User Manual. As the user gains knowledge he also begins to understand the customizing settings for his implementation.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that it falls between two teams the MM team and the FI team and each assumes that the other is responsible for the design and configuration of Invoice Verification. Although the process can be streamlined, many organizations get the design and use of invoice verification wrong, resulting in vendors not being paid and accounts being placed on stop, which prevents further Purchase Orders from being processed until the vendor has been paid. The aim of this book is to help readers fully understand the invoice verification process, particularly the changes in ERP 6.0. If they get the design right, then the process will run smoothly and vendors will be paid on time (not too early either). User input can be kept to a minimum and much of the process can be automatic. There are one or two basic mistakes that are made during the design of the process and the guide highlights these (and many other confusing areas), and describes, in simple terms, the options available along with the consequences of getting it wrong. Stephen Birchall has more than 34 years of IT consulting experience and has spent the last 24 years as a SAP consultant. Stephen has expansive knowledge of SAP systems and modules, his primary area of expertise is SAP MM and AP processes. Stephen worked as a Lead Logistics Trainer at the SAP UK training center for 4 years, delivering a wide spectrum of SAP logistics courses including Invoice Verification / AP courses. In each of those 4 years 1995/6/7 and 8 SAP identified Stephen as the highest rated SAP trainer in the UK. While at the training center in the UK, Stephen single-handedly delivered the 5 week MM Academy ten times, back-to-back and loved every minute of it! Mr. Birchall was asked by SAP AG to write some additional exam questions for SAP''s MM exam. Stephen''s enthusiasm for SAP software is based on his first-hand experience of its capabilities on various projects at several major organizations, including several assignments for Deloitte, Accenture, SAP and HCL Axon.

These materials consist of metal centers tethered through multifunctional organic linkers to promote higher dimensional compounds. As such, self-assembly under hydrothermal conditions has been employed to synthesize extended dimensional homometallic and heterometallic actinide based coordination polymers. The uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) metal centers in these materials showed an affinity towards binding with the ligand in a bidentate fashion through a carboxylate oxygen atom and nitrogen from a heterocyclic aromatic forming a 5-membered ring. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the uranium based coordination polymers were investigated. The fluorescence of hexavalent uranium in both solution and the solid state is known to derive from vibronic transitions of the central uranyl moiety, UO22+. Upon excitation of the uranyl cation, the characteristic emission between 450-600 nm results from the symmetric stretching of the O=U bond with known vibronic frequency of 860 cm-1. The frequencies for the homometallic materials were calculated to range from 862-894 cm-1 agreeing with the literature value of 860 cm-1. The pyridinedicarboxylic acid series illustrated a fascinating feature in the emission spectra: shoulder peaks. Attempts to correlate the shoulder peaks with the geometric nature of the uranyl cation in each compound are presented herein. When the uranyl cation was excited in the heterometallic compounds within the 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid systems, the characteristic emission was not detected. This observation indicates that the copper (II) metal centers may provide an alternative pathway for non-radiative decay. In compound 13, the copper and uranium metal centers are bridged through a uranyl oxygen atom. This change in the uranyl environment may also contribute to the lack of detectable uranyl emission. Conversely, uranyl emission was observed when either copper (II) or lead (II) was incorporated into the uranium-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid system (compounds 8 and 11). This occurrence may be the first instance where uranyl emission was observed in the presence of a transition metal in the solid state. These photophysical properties along with the structural schematics of the various systems will be discussed.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGKeGhZfzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Controlling the Hydrothermal Conditions to Synthesize Novel Uranium-based Heterometallic Coordination Polymers and Their Subsequent Fluorescence Investigations');

Structural analyses have revealed that Ni/CoO nanoparticles with a thin (∼1nm) NiO intermediate layer in the form of Ni/NiO/CoO can only be formed under certain conditions within the limitation of the system. Furthermore magnetic measurements have shown that the coupling between the thin NiO and CoO layers causes the growth of a new anisotropy that in turn enhances the exchange coupling between Ni and NiO resulting in larger HEB (778Oe at 5K) as compared to a similar Ni/NiO (80Oe at 5K) structure.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fUyOmT-ievEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Core/shell Structured Magnetic Nanoparticles Synthesized by Inert Gas Condensation');

No previous methodology to quantify d-limonene in the adipose had been developed which significantly limited d-limonene tissue distribution research.

In All Joy and No Fun, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior now asks: what are the effects of children on their parents? In All Joy and No Fun, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior tries to tackle this question, isolating and analyzing the many ways in which children reshape their parents'' lives, whether it''s their marriages, their jobs, their habits, their hobbies, their friendships, or their internal senses of self. She argues that changes in the last half century have radically altered the roles of today''s mothers and fathers, making their mandates at once more complex and far less clear. Recruiting from a wide variety of sources—in history, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology—she dissects both the timeless strains of parenting and the ones that are brand new, and then brings her research to life in the homes of ordinary parents around the country. The result is an unforgettable series of family portraits, starting with parents of young children and progressing to parents of teens. Through lively and accessible storytelling, Senior follows these mothers and fathers as they wrestle with some of parenthood''s deepest vexations—and luxuriate in some of its finest rewards. Meticulously researched yet imbued with emotional intelligence, All Joy and No Fun makes us reconsider some of our culture''s most basic beliefs about parenthood, all while illuminating the profound ways children deepen and add purpose to our lives. By focusing on parenthood, rather than parenting, the book is original and essential reading for mothers and fathers of today—and tomorrow.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTgHAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'All Joy and No Fun');

This practical book covers a wide range of antenna array topics that are becoming increasingly important in wireless applications, with emphasis on array design, applications, and computer modeling. Each chapter in Antenna Arrays builds upon the previous chapter, progressively addressing more difficult material. Beginning with basic electromagnetics/antennas/antenna systems information, the book then deals with the analysis and synthesis of arrays of point sources and their associated array factors. It presents a sampling of different antenna elements that replace these point sources, then presents element configurations that do not have to lie along a line or in a plane. The complex and difficult-to-predict interactions of elements and electromagnetic waves are introduced, along with computer modeling and experiments that are necessary for predicting the performance of arrays where mutual coupling is important. Then, various approaches to getting signals to and from the array elements to a computer where the signal detection takes place are explored, as are the numerical techniques behind smart antennas. The book emphasizes the computational methods used in the design and analysis of array antennas. Also featured are signal processing and numerical modeling algorithms, as well as pictures of antenna arrays and components provided by industry and government sources, with explanations of how they operate. Fully course-tested, Antenna Arrays serves as a complete text in phased array design and theory for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in electronics and communications, as well as a reference for practicing engineers and scientists in wireless communications, radar, and remote sensing.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yczb-1EsYqAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Antenna Arrays');

Sensor arrays helped usher in the age of wireless communication by meeting the increasing capacity requirements of ever growing wireless networks, but that is only one example of the number of uses served by this valuable technology across any number of fields. Extensively updated and expanded, Sensor Array Signal Processing, Second Edition covers a wide range of interrelated topics in array processing to provide an introduction to the field that one will not find in the literature. The book introduces new developments in the use of sensors in wireless networks and the use of distributed sensors for localization. It unravels layers of complexity to explore underlying basic principles of array signal processing, focusing on the common threads that exist in wavefield analysis, rather than on particular applications. Following an introduction to the basic equations governing different wavefields, the text provides updated coverage on current topics of interest. It analyzes various types of sensor configurations; focusing on those most useful for understanding array systems in practice — uniform linear and circular arrays. Fully updated with over 150 new pages, this new edition: Includes new chapters — emphasizing the use of sensor arrays in wireless communication and localization Adds new exercises and examples to the end of each chapter Provides information on emerging topics covering, distributed sensor array, multi-component sensors, space-time processing, azimuth/elevation estimation, wideband adaptive beamformation, and frequency invariant beamformation An invaluable tool for self-study, this book provides those working in or interested in medical imaging, astronomy, radar, communications, sonar, seismology or any field that studies propagating wavefields, with a highly accessible guide. It describes each concept in precise mathematical language complete with numerical examples, detailed illustrations, and practice exercises at the end of each chapter to reinforce concepts.

Recently, several other researchers have followed us in this journey and have published interesting books with their own visions and perspectives. The idea of writing a book on Microphone Array Signal Processing comes from discussions we have had with many colleagues and friends. As a c- sequence of these discussions, we came up with the conclusion that, again, there is an urgent need for a monograph that carefully explains the theory and implementation of microphone arrays. While there are many manuscripts on antenna arrays from a narrowband perspective (narrowband signals and narrowband processing), the literature is quite scarce when it comes to s- sor arrays explained from a truly broadband perspective.

This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications. The authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphics-knowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, program­ming problems, and hands-on projects. This revised edition features New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces 3D real-time graphics platforms-their design goals and trade-offs-including new mobile and browser platforms Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development The text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book.

It focusses upon how soft law fits into the Community legal system, and how it is used, and, in particular, how it relates to Community legislation.Differentiation of the Community instruments, including the instruments of soft law, is often thought to enhance the effectiveness, legitimacy and transparency of the Community. This book asks whether soft law indeed provides a satisfactory alternative to legislation from this perspective and, if so, in what cases and under what conditions. Furthermore, the author asks to what extent the use of soft law implies good governance, and throws fresh light on this very heterogenous phenomenon, by looking at frequently used instruments in many different areas of Community law, such as competition law, state aid, environment, social policy etc., in the process identifying their different characteristics, aims, functions and legal effects. What emerges is that the conditions under which soft law is used may be problematic in relation to increasing the legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency of Community action.This is a work which will interest legal practitioners confronted with the use of soft law and the question of its possible legal effect in an increasing number of sectors and academics interested in the vexed question of how the increased use of soft law can be justified in a Community legal order built upon the rule of law. It is also critical of developments taking place within the framework of the European Convention and the proposed European Constitution, and goes beyond the immediate problems of soft law to touch upon issues such as competence, legal protection, division of powers between the EC and the Member States, institutional balance, lawmaking by the Community Courts, the scope of Community legal principles and the influence of soft law on the progressive development of both Community and national law.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B9Z82q_LXzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Law in European Community Law');

Particularly worthy of note is the inclusion of a wealth of information about neuro-fuzzy, neuro-genetic, fuzzy-genetic and neuro-fuzzy-genetic systems, with many illuminating applications and examples.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C05X9svt8WQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Computing and Its Applications');

It is now used frequently—and often incorrectly—by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power—the ability to coerce—grows out of a country''s military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country''s culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration''s new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America''s military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power.

But while autobiography and other genres of life writing can help us attend to people whose experiences are frequently unseen and unheard, life narratives can also be easily co-opted into propaganda. In Soft Weapons, Gillian Whitlock explores the dynamism and ubiquity of contemporary life writing about the Middle East and shows how these works have been packaged, promoted, and enlisted in Western controversies. Considering recent autoethnographies of Afghan women, refugee testimony from Middle Eastern war zones, Jean Sasson’s bestsellers about the lives of Arab women, Norma Khouri’s fraudulent memoir Honor Lost, personal accounts by journalists reporting the war in Iraq, Satrapi’s Persepolis, Nafisi’s book, and Pax’s blog, Whitlock explores the contradictions and ambiguities in the rapid commodification of life memoirs. Drawing from the fields of literary and cultural studies, Soft Weapons will be essential reading for scholars of life writing and those interested in the exchange of literary culture between Islam and the West.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4C09Yao332gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Weapons');

In China, soft power has become one of the most frequently used phrases among political leaders, leading academics, and journalists. Defined against hard power, which often involves threat and coercion, soft power applies attraction, persuasion, and cooperation, finding its sources in culture, political values, and foreign policies. China, rich in culture and traditional philosophy, boasts abundant sources of soft power. Soft Power attempts to analyze the domestic and international views of China''s soft power, the main strengths and weaknesses of China''s soft power, and the application of soft power in China''s international politics. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the soft power dimension in China''s foreign relations by integrating views from various disciplines, such as history, education, culture, political economy, comparative politics, and philosophy. The book argues that soft power has become a very popular concept in China, that China is contemplating and exploring an innovative strategy in its rise and international politics, and that there have been quite a few notable elements of this in China''s diplomatic practice, including softer rhetoric, promotion of the Chinese culture abroad, economic diplomacy, and image building. The book also argues that the limitations of China''s soft power primarily stem from political values and China''s own transitions, and reflects the reality that views and opinions regarding China''s soft power are fairly diverse both in China and in the international arena.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_6Oqbe6W9C0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Power');

Because international financial rules are expressed through informal, non-binding accords, scholars tend to view them as either weak treaty substitutes or by-products of national power. Rarely, if ever, are they cast as independent variables that can inform the behavior of regulators and market participants alike. This book explains how international financial law ''works'' - and presents an alternative theory for understanding its purpose, operation and limitations. Drawing on a close institutional analysis of the post-crisis financial architecture, it argues that international financial law is often bolstered by a range of reputational, market and institutional mechanisms that make it more coercive than classical theories of international law predict.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XuBXY0OdnWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Law and the Global Financial System');

For Powers, science is something more than the accumulation of technical data and the proliferation of theories developed to explain physical phenomena. It is an evolving body of knowledge which has important insights to contribute into the conditions which ground human experience The close and often detailed discussions of contemporary issues in science which Powers incorporates into his fiction indicate the extent to which he sees science as an inseparable component in any attempt to understand the complexities of human experience. The common ground Powers uses to link the interests of science and those of fiction into a balanced, if not always harmonious, pursuit of truth is wonder. The limitations placed on science during this century do not undermine the ability of science to influence what we can know. Nor do these limitations diminish the ability of science to inspire wonder. Quite the opposite. For Powers the true wonder of the human intellect rests in our remarkable ability to balance observation and interpretation. What he discovers again and again in his fiction is that science, like literature, is a product of the human imagination, a way to mediate between the world and our perceptions of it. The recognition that science is a cultural practice--a body of knowledge thoroughly imbued with the practices and prejudices of its historical surroundings--is a necessary first step in mending the rift separating science and literature, head and heart. The greatest insight of twentieth century science may just be the recognition that there are other ways to access the truth.

This work also describes the experiences that lead to the rigid canalization of behavioral development as well as the social and sensory experiences that favor the continuance of flexibility. The author also describes in detail a developmental psychobiological systems view that supports a behaviorally and psychologically mediated pathway to evolutionary change in humans and other species. Written in a way that is readable to even the nonspecialist, the text is accompanied by numerous photographs that illuminate and add personal meaning to the written words. Readers will be engaged by the emphasis on the human aspect of the scientific enterprise.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eyePBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Synthesizing Nature-nurture');

Johanns began to publish a steady stream of articles in the monthly "Light of the East" that analysed pertinent features of "Vedantic" thought from the perspective of his neo-Thomistic presuppositions. Johanns engaged in a thorough explication and analysis of the thinking of the Hindu teachers Sankara, Ramanuja, and Vallabha. He attempted to fashion a creative synthesis of their views, constructing a new, holistic metaphysic from the raw material of their respective philosophical theologies.

In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

It develops a novel framework, calling into question both primordial and modernist approaches to nationalism and national identity, before applying that framework to Croatia. In doing so it provides a new way of thinking about how national identity is formed and why it is so important. An explanation is given of how Croatian national identity was formed in the abstract, via a historical narrative that traces centuries of yearning for a national state. The book shows how the government, opposition parties, dissident intellectuals and diaspora groups offered alternative accounts of this narrative in order to legitimize contemporary political programmes based on different versions of national identity. It then looks at how these debates were manifested in social activities as diverse as football, religion, economics and language.

This means that breadth of knowledge required by such professionals is so wide that previous books addressing plant engineering have either been limited to only certain subjects or cursory in their treatment of topics. The Plant Engineering Handbook offers comprehensive coverage of an enormous range of subjects which are of vital interest to the plant engineer and anyone connected with industrial operations or maintenance. This handbook is packed with indispensable information, from defining just what a Plant Engineer actually does, through selection of a suitable site for a factory and provision of basic facilities (including boilers, electrical systems, water, HVAC systems, pumping systems and floors and finishes) to issues such as lubrication, corrosion, energy conservation, maintenance and materials handling as well as environmental considerations, insurance matters and financial concerns. One of the major features of this volume is its comprehensive treatment of the maintenance management function; in addition to chapters which outline the operation of the various plant equipment there is specialist advice on how to get the most out of that equipment and its operators. This will enable the reader to reap the rewards of more efficient operations, more effective employee contributions and in turn more profitable performance from the plant and the business to which it contributes. The Editor, Keith Mobley and the team of expert contributors, have practiced at the highest levels in leading corporations across the USA, Europe and the rest of the world.

The beaver is a keystone species—their skills as foresters and engineers create and maintain ponds and wetlands that increase biodiversity, purify water, and prevent large-scale flooding. Biologists have long studied their daily and seasonal routines, family structures, and dispersal patterns. As human development encroaches into formerly wild areas, property owners and government authorities need new, nonlethal strategies for dealing with so-called nuisance beavers. At the same time, the complex behavior of beavers intrigues visitors at parks and other wildlife viewing sites because it is relatively easy to observe.In an up-to-date, exhaustively illustrated, and comprehensive book on beaver biology and management, Dietland Müller-Schwarze and Lixing Sun gather a wealth of scientific knowledge about both the North American and Eurasian beaver species. The Beaver is designed to satisfy the curiosity and answer the questions of anyone with an interest in these animals, from students who enjoy watching beaver ponds at nature centers to homeowners who hope to protect their landscaping. Photographs taken by the authors document every aspect of beaver behavior and biology, the variety of their constructions, and the habitats that depend on their presence. Beaver facts:•Just as individual beavers shape their immediate surroundings, so did the distribution of beavers across North America influence the paths of English and French explorers and traders. As a result of the fur trade, beavers were wiped out across large areas of the United States. Reintroduction efforts led to the widespread establishment of these resilient animals, and now they are found throughout North America, Europe, and parts of the southern hemisphere.•Beaver meadows provided early settlers with level, fertile pastures and hayfields.•Based on the fossil record, the smallest extinct beaver species were the size of a muskrat, and the largest may have reached the size of a black bear (five to six times as large as today''s North American beavers). Beaver-gnawed wood has been found alongside the skeleton of a mastodon.•Some beavers remain in the home lodge for an extra year to assist their parents in raising younger siblings. They feed, groom, and guard the newborn kits.•In 1600, beaver ponds covered eleven percent of the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers'' watershed above Thebes, Illinois. Restoring only 3 percent of the original wetlands might suffice to prevent catastrophic floods such as those in the early 1990s.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqIenKko3lAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Beaver');

But if she''s got a hell of a lot of nerve and a knack for finding the funny side in even the worst situations, she just might triumph over her circumstances. Our heroine Hawa does, and she did. In the 1970s, John Chernoff recorded the story of her life as an "ashawo," or bar girl, making a living on gifts from men and her own quick wits, and here presents it in Hustling Is Not Stealing, one of the most remarkable "autobiographies" you will ever encounter. What might have been a sad tale of hardship and exploitation turns instead into a fascinating send-up of life in modern Africa, thanks to Hawa''s smarts, savvy, and ear for telling just the right story to make her point. Through her wide-open and knowing eyes, we get an inside view of what life is really like for young people in West Africa. We spy on nightlife scenes of sex and deception; we see how modern-minded youth deal with life in the cities in villages; and we share the sweet and sometimes silly friendships formed in the streets and bars. But mostly we come to know Hawa and how she has navigated a life that few can even imagine. The first of two funny, poignant volumes, Hustling starts with an in-depth introduction by Chernoff to Hawa''s Africa. From there the book traces her remarkable transformation from a playful warrior struggling against her circumstances to an insightful trickster enjoying and taking advantage of them as best she can. Part coming-of-age story, part ethnography, and all compulsively readable, Hustling Is Not Stealing is a rare book that educates as thoroughly as it entertains. "You can see some people outside, and you will think they are enjoying, but they are suffering. Every time in some nightclub, you will see a girl dressed nicely, and she''s dancing, she''s happy. You will say, ''Ah! This girl!'' You don''t know what problem she has got. Some people say that this life, it''s unto us. It''s unto us? Yeah, it''s unto me, but sometimes it''s not unto me. When I was growing up, I didn''t feel like doing all these things. There is not any girl who will wake up as a young girl and say, ''As for me, when I grow up, I want to be ashawo, to go with everybody.'' Not any girl will think of this."—from the book Winner - 2004 Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qecq01y4EGEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Hustling Is Not Stealing');

Rejecting traditional marriage options and cut off from family support, she is like many women in Africa who come to depend on the help they receive from one another, from boyfriends, and from the men they meet in bars and nightclubs. Refusing to see herself as a victim, Hawa embraces the freedom her lifestyle permits and seeks the broadest experience available to her. In Exchange Is Not Robbery and its predecessor, Hustling Is Not Stealing, a chronicle of exploitation is transformed by verbal art into an ebullient comedy. In Hustling Is Not Stealing, Hawa is a playful warrior struggling against circumstances in Ghana and Togo. In Exchange Is Not Robbery, Hawa returns to her native Burkina Faso, where she achieves greater control over her life but faces new difficulties. As a woman making sacrifices to live independently, Hawa sees her own situation become more complex as she confronts an atmosphere in Burkina Faso that is in some ways more challenging than the one she left behind, and the moral ambiguities of her life begin to intensify. Combining elements of folklore and memoir, Hawa''s stories portray the diverse social landscape of West Africa.

In this first full-length examination of the political economy of adjustment in Ghana, Jeffrey Herbst describes the causes of Ghana''s dramatic economic decline and reviews the politics of reform that began in 1983. Ghana was one of the first African countries to adopt a comprehensive reform program and the one that has sustained adjustment longest. As Africa confronts the possibility of total economic collapse by the turn of the century, the Ghanaian experience will have profound ramifications across the continent in the debates regarding stabilization and structural change. Herbst devotes special attention to the interaction between the type of government and the politics of adjustment, the reaction of interest groups such as urban labor and the peasantry, and the relationship between economic and political change. His extended field research and sophisticated knowledge of the issues involved, both from the economic and political science literature, make this an extremely useful study.

The demand for total output volume and purity of such water has been significantly increasing during the last decades. Electromembrane processes provide a more sustainable and cost effective water purification compared to alternative processes like distillation and ion-exchange deionization. In the first part of the publication a review of processes used for deionization of water is presented and main physicochemical phenomena occurring in electromembrane processes will be discussed. The subsequent parts are devoted to the experimental verification of novel improvements for two electromembrane processes: electrodialysis and continuous electrodeionization. Considering electrodialysis, an investigation on ion-exchange membranes with profiled surfaces will be presented. It includes a section of appropriate membrane manufacturing procedures and desalination tests with profiled membranes. It turns out that electrodialysis with profiled ion-exchange membranes is superior to conventional electrodialysis with flat membranes and spacers, in particular with respect to desalination degree and reduced energy consumption. Considering continuous electrodeionization, experimental studies concerning improvements of continuous electrodeionization with bipolar membranes will be presented and discussed. Influence of ion-exchange membrane permselectivity on the product water quality is demonstrated and proposed improvements are aimed to reduce this influence. Concepts with a so-called protection compartment will be discussed and compared experimentally with a concept where the concentrate compartments are filled with ion exchange resin beads. It will be shown that improved continuous electrodeionization with bipolar membranes is able to produce ultrapure water in a quality comparable to conventional mixed-bed ion-exchangers but in a more cost effective and sustainable way.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ORVFoMq6HroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Electromembrane Desalination Processes for Production of Low Conductivity Water');

Comparison of nested and non-nested sampling protocols found no statistical differences in the parameters of species-area curves.

The Nasser regime is interpreted as essentially a praetorian political system, in which the military has the potential to dominate the political structure, with the army as a core group and as a ruling class. In such a system, political leadership is recruited mainly from the army. This volume chronicles the evolution of praetorian regimes in general, and then interprets Nasser''s ascendancy to power from this perspective. The 1956 takeover ofthe Suez Canal and Nasser''s transformation of his 1967 military debacle into a national "victory" is analyzed as the climax of his career. His inability to cement the uncomfortable federation with Syria and the imbroglio over his intervention in Yemen are seen as the beginning of his decline, culminating in the disastrous Six-Day War and his failure to prevent Hussein''s annihilation of the Palestinians in Jordan. Nasser''s contribution to the new style of politics prevalent in the Arab and sub-Saharan African worlds is evaluated. Also included is an analysis of the machinations of coup-preparing and coup-making, and comments on the neo-Islamic, corporate orientations of the post-Nasser praetorians. Perlmutter''s work is unique in its combination of extensive scholarship, kowledge of Egyptian politics and familiarity with and ability to use current social science concepts.

Viewed as an age of empire, dominated by the figure of Ramesses II, this period witnessed crucial developments in art, language, and religious display. Biographical Texts from Ramesside Egypt offers insights into these cultural transformations through the voices of thirty-one priests, artisans, civic officials, and governmental administrators who served under the kings of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties. Forty-six biographical texts, which were inscribed in tombs, on statues and stelae in temples, and even on temple walls, give details of their careers and character. The translations are introduced by brief descriptions of the texts'' monumental contexts and, where possible, summaries of the careers of their owners. They are formatted metrically and in stanzas to emphasize their poetic form and to foster a clearer understanding of them. The volume offers an introduction to the historical background of the Ramesside period and draws together some of the key themes and interpretive issues raised by the texts and their contexts. These include the representation of the people''s relationships to god and king, the thematization of the priestly life, and the various transformations of the texts'' media, including the implications of the change in the decorative programs of nonroyal tombs and the use of temple walls for some inscriptions.

This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you''ve already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book''s companion web site. The rules include how to: Make Fewer HTTP Requests Use a Content Delivery Network Add an Expires Header Gzip Components Put Stylesheets at the Top Put Scripts at the Bottom Avoid CSS Expressions Make JavaScript and CSS External Reduce DNS Lookups Minify JavaScript Avoid Redirects Remove Duplicates Scripts Configure ETags Make Ajax Cacheable If you''re building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable. "If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve''s guidelines, the Web would be adramatically better place.

The device is envisaged as a Low-Power subcutaneous implantable application powered by an inductive link, one emitter antenna at the external side of the skin and the receiver antenna under the skin. The sensor is controlled with a Potentiostat circuit and then, a post-processing unit detects the desired levels and activates the transmission via a backscattering method by the inductive link.

Servlets, JSPs, and EJBs are the most important aspects of Java as it is used in the production of enterprise Web applications today. Lennart Jorelid''s book concentrates on teaching programmers how to fit the various technologies together while spending as little time as possible on "plumbing." Jorelid discusses servlet development and architecture, and he teaches developers how to integrate servlets into distributed enterprise systems with illustrated examples. He explains the architecture and implementation of JSPs—including introductory concepts such as using all built-in facilities of the JSP library and advanced topics such as creating your own custom actions using the JSP Tag Library API. Jorelid also addresses the open-source Struts framework from the Apache Software Foundation, which provides a powerful framework for J2EE Web application development by combining servlets and JSPs. And, finally, Jorelid explores the EJB programming paradigm, covering development and architecture of EJBs and J2EE integration and deployment. J2EE FrontEnd Technologies: A Programmer''s Guide to Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise JavaBeans provides developers with a unique approach to understanding the profound relationship between servlets, JSPs, and EJBs.

Three major classes of optic flow computation techniques can discriminated (see for a good overview Beauchemin and Barron IBeauchemin19951): gradient based (or differential) methods; phase based (or frequency domain) methods; correlation based (or area) methods; feature point (or sparse data) tracking methods; In this chapter we compute the optic flow as a dense optic flow field with a multi scale differential method. The method, originally proposed by Florack and Nielsen [Florack1998a] is known as the Multiscale Optic Flow Constrain Equation (MOFCE). This is a scale space version of the well known computer vision implementation of the optic flow constraint equation, as originally proposed by Horn and Schunck [Horn1981]. This scale space variation, as usual, consists of the introduction of the aperture of the observation in the process. The application to stereo has been described by Maas et al. [Maas 1995a, Maas 1996a]. Of course, difficulties arise when structure emerges or disappears, such as with occlusion, cloud formation etc. Then knowledge is needed about the processes and objects involved. In this chapter we focus on the scale space approach to the local measurement of optic flow, as we may expect the visual front end to do. 17. 2 Motion detection with pairs of receptive fields As a biologically motivated start, we begin with discussing some neurophysiological findings in the visual system with respect to motion detection.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JaMSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Front-End Vision and Multi-Scale Image Analysis');

Development of radio frequency ICs Wireless communications has been advancing rapidly in the past two decades. Many high performance systems have been developed, such as cellular systems (AMPS, GSM, TDMA, CDMA, W-CDMA, etc. ), GPS system (global po- tioning system) and WLAN (wireless local area network) systems. The rapid growth of VLSI technology in both digital circuits and analog circuits provides benefits for wireless communication systems. Twenty years ago not many p- ple could imagine millions of transistors in a single chip or a complete radio for size of a penny. Now not only complete radios have been put in a single chip, but also more and more functions have been realized by a single chip and at a much lower price. A radio transmits and receives electro-magnetic signals through the air. The signals are usually transmitted on high frequency carriers. For example, a t- ical voice signal requires only 30 Kilohertz bandwidth. When it is transmitted by a FM radio station, it is often carried by a frequency in the range of tens of megahertz to hundreds of megahertz. Usually a radio is categorized by its carrier frequency, such as 900 MHz radio or 5 GHz radio. In general, the higher the carrier frequency, the better the directivity, but the more difficult the radio design.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXJCAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'High-Linearity CMOS RF Front-End Circuits');

For their trail horses, they adopted wild mustangs from the US Bureau of Land Management that were perfectly adapted to the rocky terrain and harsh conditions of desert and mountain travel. A meticulously planned but sometimes unpredictable route brought them face to face with snowpack, downpours, and wildfire; unrelenting heat, raging rivers, and sheer cliffs; jumping cactus, rattlesnakes, and charging bull moose; sickness, injury, and death. But they also experienced a special camaraderie with each other and with the mustangs. Through it all, they had a constant traveling companion—a cameraman, shooting for the documentary film Unbranded. The trip’s inspiration and architect, Ben Masters, is joined here by the three other riders, Ben Thamer, Thomas Glover, and Jonny Fitzsimons; two memorable teachers and horse trainers; and the film’s producers and intrepid cameramen in the telling of this improbable story of adventure and self-discovery.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otosBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Unbranded');

We walk on it, drive on it, and many of us live and work within its walls. But very few of us know what it is. We take for granted this ubiquitous substance, which both literally and figuratively comprises much of modern civilization’s constructed environment; yet the story of its creation and development features a cast of fascinating characters and remarkable historical episodes. This book delves into this history, opening readers’ eyes at every turn. In a lively narrative peppered with intriguing details, author Robert Corland describes how some of the most famous personalities of history became involved in the development and use of concrete—including King Herod the Great of Judea, the Roman emperor Hadrian, Thomas Edison (who once owned the largest concrete cement plant in the world), and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Courland points to recent archaeological evidence suggesting that the discovery of concrete directly led to the Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the earliest civilizations. Much later, the Romans reached extraordinarily high standards for concrete production, showcasing their achievement in iconic buildings like the Coliseum and the Pantheon. Amazingly, with the fall of the Roman Empire, the secrets of concrete manufacturing were lost for over a millennium. The author explains that when concrete was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century it was initially viewed as an interesting novelty or, at best, a specialized building material suitable only for a narrow range of applications. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that the use of concrete exploded. During this rapid expansion, industry lobbyists tried to disguise the fact that modern concrete had certain defects and critical shortcomings. It is now recognized that modern concrete, unlike its Roman predecessor, gradually disintegrates with age. Compounding this problem is another distressing fact: the manufacture of concrete cement is a major contributor to global warming. Concrete Planet is filled with incredible stories, fascinating characters, surprising facts, and an array of intriguing insights into the building material that forms the basis of the infrastructure on which we depend.

She provides the geological background of the local building stones and applies mineralogical analysis to determine material provenance, which in turn suggests trading patterns and land use. Lancaster also examines construction techniques in relation to the social, economic, and political contexts of Rome, in an effort to draw connections between changes in the building industry and the events that shaped Roman society from the early empire to late antiquity.

These materials consist of metal centers tethered through multifunctional organic linkers to promote higher dimensional compounds. As such, self-assembly under hydrothermal conditions has been employed to synthesize extended dimensional homometallic and heterometallic actinide based coordination polymers. The uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) metal centers in these materials showed an affinity towards binding with the ligand in a bidentate fashion through a carboxylate oxygen atom and nitrogen from a heterocyclic aromatic forming a 5-membered ring. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the uranium based coordination polymers were investigated. The fluorescence of hexavalent uranium in both solution and the solid state is known to derive from vibronic transitions of the central uranyl moiety, UO22+. Upon excitation of the uranyl cation, the characteristic emission between 450-600 nm results from the symmetric stretching of the O=U bond with known vibronic frequency of 860 cm-1. The frequencies for the homometallic materials were calculated to range from 862-894 cm-1 agreeing with the literature value of 860 cm-1. The pyridinedicarboxylic acid series illustrated a fascinating feature in the emission spectra: shoulder peaks. Attempts to correlate the shoulder peaks with the geometric nature of the uranyl cation in each compound are presented herein. When the uranyl cation was excited in the heterometallic compounds within the 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid systems, the characteristic emission was not detected. This observation indicates that the copper (II) metal centers may provide an alternative pathway for non-radiative decay. In compound 13, the copper and uranium metal centers are bridged through a uranyl oxygen atom. This change in the uranyl environment may also contribute to the lack of detectable uranyl emission. Conversely, uranyl emission was observed when either copper (II) or lead (II) was incorporated into the uranium-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid system (compounds 8 and 11). This occurrence may be the first instance where uranyl emission was observed in the presence of a transition metal in the solid state. These photophysical properties along with the structural schematics of the various systems will be discussed.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGKeGhZfzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Controlling the Hydrothermal Conditions to Synthesize Novel Uranium-based Heterometallic Coordination Polymers and Their Subsequent Fluorescence Investigations');

However, Kenya''s independence has always been circumscribed by its failure to transcend its colonial past: its governments have failed to achieve adequate living conditions for most of its citizens and its politics have been fraught with controversy - illustrated most recently by the post-election protests and violence in 2007. The decisions of the early years of independence, and the acts of its leaders in the decades since - from Jomo Kenyatta, Tom Mboya, and Oginga Odinga to Daniel arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki - have changed the country''s path in unpredictable ways, but key themes of conflicts remain: over land, tribalism - including the simmering Kikuyu-Luo rivalries - money, power, national autonomy, and the distribution of resources. The political elite''s endless struggle for access to state resources has damaged Kenya''s economy and the political exploitation of ethnicity still threatens the country''s stability. In this definitive new history, Charles Hornsby demonstrates how independent Kenya''s politics have been dominated by a struggle to deliver security, impartiality, efficiency, and growth, but how the legacies of the past have continued to undermine their achievement, making the long-term future of Kenya far from certain.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=je4Aw1SpY3oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Kenya');

insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('This book is about Kenya as a country and as a nation. It is also a work of comparative analysis in the African context. It also focuses on the nation as an entity with its own personality and national character. Kenya is one of the most well-known countries in Africa for several reasons. It is one of the major tourist destinations in the world. It is, by African standards, one of the most developed countries on the continent. It also occupies a special place in the history of Africa because of the role it played in the struggle for independence. It was in Kenya where Mau Mau, an uprising against colonial injustices, was fought. Mau Mau was one of the bloodiest and most successful wars in colonial history, and it thrust Kenya into the international spotlight. It also earned the Mau Mau freedom fighters distinction as some of the most outstanding champions of freedom for Africans and as some of the most revered fighters in the struggle for African liberation from imperial rule. They are still remembered today not only as gallant fighters but as some of the pioneers of the African independence movement. Jomo Kenyatta himself, who was accused of leading Mau Mau and who later became the first president of Kenya, was one of the most respected African leaders and was revered as the Grand Old Man of the African independence movement. He cast a long shadow over Kenya and the rest of the continent and his formidable personality and legendary role as the leader of the independence movement also played a major role in thrusting his country on the international scene. Kenya is also the economic powerhouse of East Africa. It has the most developed and the strongest economy among all the countries which constitute the East African Community (EAC). They are Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi. It is, in fact, the most developed country in the entire region of Eastern Africa which includes the countries in the Horn of Africa: Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti. This work is a general introduction to Kenya as a country and as a nation. Subjects covered include a short history of the country, its geography including administrative provinces and various ethnic groups in those provinces; Mau Mau and the struggle for independence; the early years of independence; political developments through the decades; the cultures of different ethnic groups; the country''s natural resources and much more. Also addressed in the book is the country''s ethnic diversity and the impact it has had on Kenya''s stability as a country and as a nation composed of different ethnic and racial groups. The author also looks at Kenya''s national character from his background as an East African himself from neighbouring Tanzania in a study of comparative analysis between Kenya and Tanzania as political entities with different national characters to demonstrate that nations do, indeed, have different national characters. This is an excellent introduction for those who want to learn about Kenya for the first time, and even for those who already know about Kenya but want to learn more about the country. Students and tourists alike will find this work to be very useful. And for those going to Kenya or anywhere else in East Africa for the first time as tourists, students, scholars or simply as travellers, the book will serve as an excellent source of information about life and different cultures and even about politics in contemporary times in one of the most dynamic countries on the African continent and which casts a shadow over the entire East African region; although the rest of the countries in the region have not been entirely eclipsed by their powerful neighbour.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lsqjN-t6mP4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Kenya');

Kenya''s political, economic, social and cultural framework has been and continues to be dominated by the colonial legacy.

Rather, the West continued its dominance by more subtle means which has permeated the very imagination of the colonised. It is this continuing colonisation of the imagination which dominates the political scene.

While private copying was practiced in the analogue world too, it was tolerated due to its minimal impact and to the difficulties related to its monitoring. Yet, its permissibility is ambiguous in the digital environment; this is because digitalisation has enabled ordinary individuals to make and share copies of copyrighted works easily, for no cost and with no degradation in terms of quality. Scholars and lawmakers stress the decisive role of private copying in striking an adequate balance between the freedom to use copyrighted works and the protection of the rightholders'' interests in the digital world. In Europe, private copying is explicitly permitted under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society and the national laws that implement it. Despite being a lawful activity in the great majority of European Member States, digital private copying remains a highly controversial phenomenon and the scope of digital private copying remains legally unclear.This book offers an original analysis of private copying and determines the actual scope of private copying as an area of end-user freedom in the digital world. In particular, it examines the permissibility of digital private copying with a view to clarify the legal uncertainty as to its scope. The basis of this examination is Article 5(2)(b) of the Information Society Directive. Under this Article, the use of copyrighted works ought to be ''private'' and ''non-commercial'' to be permitted; these concepts, however, do not translate well, and tend to be less sharp, in the digital environment. Even though their meaning seems clear and self-evident, their legal boundaries are in practice very vague and not settled by law"--', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Nu_Yy5RcmkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Private Copying');

But as Richard Iton shows in this provocative and insightful volume, despite the changes brought about by the civil rights movement, and contrary to the wishes of those committed to narrower conceptions of politics, black artists have continued to play a significant role in the making and maintenance of critical social spaces. Iton offers an original portrait of the relationship between popular culture and institutionalized politics tracing the connections between artists such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Pryor, Bob Marley, and Erykah Badu and those individuals working in the protest, electoral, and policy making arenas. With an emphasis on questions of class, gender and sexuality-and diaspora and coloniality-the author also illustrates how creative artists destabilize modern notions of the proper location of politics, and politics itself. Ranging from theater to film, and comedy to literature and contemporary music, In Search of the Black Fantastic is an engaging and sophisticated examination of how black popular culture has challenged our understandings of the aesthetic and its relationship to politics.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=An3xv7mXeQAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'In Search of the Black Fantastic');

Argentina—in all its complexity—has often been obscured by variations of the "like Europe and not like the rest of Latin America" cliché. The Argentina Reader deliberately breaks from that viewpoint. This essential introduction to Argentina’s history, culture, and society provides a richer, more comprehensive look at one of the most paradoxical of Latin American nations: a nation that used to be among the richest in the world, with the largest middle class in Latin America, yet one that entered the twenty-first century with its economy in shambles and its citizenry seething with frustration. This diverse collection brings together songs, articles, comic strips, scholarly essays, poems, and short stories. Most pieces are by Argentines. More than forty of the texts have never before appeared in English. The Argentina Reader contains photographs from Argentina’s National Archives and images of artwork by some of the country’s most talented painters and sculptors. Many selections deal with the history of indigenous Argentines, workers, women, blacks, and other groups often ignored in descriptions of the country. At the same time, the book includes excerpts by or about such major political figures as José de San Martín and Juan Perón. Pieces from literary and social figures virtually unknown in the United States appear alongside those by more well-known writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Ricardo Piglia, and Julio Cortázar. The Argentina Reader covers the Spanish colonial regime; the years of nation building following Argentina’s independence from Spain in 1810; and the sweeping progress of economic growth and cultural change that made Argentina, by the turn of the twentieth century, the most modern country in Latin America. The bulk of the collection focuses on the twentieth century: on the popular movements that enabled Peronism and the revolutionary dreams of the 1960s and 1970s; on the dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 and the accompanying culture of terror and resistance; and, finally, on the contradictory and disconcerting tendencies unleashed by the principles of neoliberalism and the new global economy. The book also includes a list of suggestions for further reading. The Argentina Reader is an invaluable resource for those interested in learning about Argentine history and culture, whether in the classroom or in preparation for travel in Argentina.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zt5ohINv7bEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Argentina Reader');

Sven Beckert''s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world''s most significant manufacturing industry combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in 1780, these men created a potent innovation (Beckert calls it war capitalism, capitalism based on unrestrained actions of private individuals; the domination of masters over slaves, of colonial capitalists over indigenous inhabitants), and crucially affected the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia. We see how this thing called war capitalism shaped the rise of cotton, and then was used as a lever to transform the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways, Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the modern world. The result is a book as unsettling and disturbing as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist"--Résumé de l''éditeur.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kIPZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Empire of Cotton');

Ronald insisted that she was mistaken-- but Jennifer''s positive identification was the compelling evidence that put him behind bars.

It does so, first of all, because it involves richer authoritative texts than does either common law or constitutional interpretation: statutes are often complex and have a detailed legislative history. Second, Congress can, and often does, rewrite statutes when it disagrees with their interpretations; and agencies and courts attend to current as well as historical congressional preferences when they interpret statutes. Third, since statutory interpretation is as much agency-centered as judgecentered and since agency executives see their creativity as more legitimate than judges see theirs, statutory interpretation in the modern regulatory state is particularly dynamic. Eskridge also considers how different normative theories of jurisprudence--liberal, legal process, and antiliberal--inform debates about statutory interpretation. He explores what theory of statutory interpretation--if any--is required by the rule of law or by democratic theory. Finally, he provides an analytical and jurisprudential history of important debates on statutory interpretation.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl2BWejLa_EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Dynamic Statutory Interpretation');

Are the financial markets really predictable? Does an ancient artifact hold the key to how some of the world s wealthiest families made their fortunes?When a mysterious granite and cypress Egyptian box is found hidden away in a secret room in the palatial Biltmore Estate, twin scientists Alex and Nicholas Shepard work to unlock the secret of its intricate dials, gauges, crystals, and carvings. What they discover has the potential to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. But it could also collapse financial markets, bankrupt corporations around the globe, and destroy many of the world s most powerful families. As the twins quickly find out, people will not only kill to make money, but will kill to keep it. What begins as a simple scientific experiment in the stock market quickly descends into a nightmarish intrigue of murder, deception, and mystery. When one Shepard brother is killed, the surviving twin and his wife find themselves in a desperate gambit to learn the truth about the box s legacy. Using ancient documents found with the box, they unearth clues to trace its history through the ages, from the catacombs of Paris to the Knights of the Templar in Scotland. Their investigation takes them from London to Paris, Venice, and finally, to the Vatican itself, where they uncover the greatest deception ever perpetuated by man. Robert D.

It''s a fabulous book about the breathtaking pursuit of the secrets behind a mysterious Egyptian box and how that desperate chase leads to riches, treachery, and murder. Paradigm is the Da Vinci Code for Wall Street arbitragers and others who enjoy fantasizing about offbeat ways to make money " (Dan E. Moldea, Author of The Hoffa Wars)"Robert Taylor''s intelligent Wall Street thriller, Paradigm, has more twists and turns than a steep mountain road. It''s a very well written, first rate murder mystery that will challenge the readers intellectually." (Vincent Bugliosi, author of Helter Skelter, ''Till Death Do Us Part, and the acclaimed New York Times #1 hardcover bestseller, And the Sea Will Tell.)"The science wrapped in this novel will challenge how we think about gravity and the relationship between science and business. Truth and fiction merge to tell an intriguing tale." (M. Douglas Ivester, Former Chairman and CEO, Coca-Cola)"Simultaneously an exciting tale of intrigue and adventure and an intellectual paradigm-quake, this enthralling reality-fiction novel''s emotionally gripping plot and players completely absorb both the reader''s mind and heart until the final, satisfying denouement." (Dr. Robert W. Bass, M.A. Oxon -Rhodes Scholar- Professor. of Physics & Astronomy, BYU 1971-81, retired) Paradigm rockets along powered by the ultimate what if. WHAT IF someone could predict when the stock market would rise or fall? Paradigm weaves a tale full of suspense and secrecy and Robert Taylor takes it even one step further the science behind the story is real! (Jeff Sagansky, past President of CBS Entertainment and Tri-Star Pictures) Paradigm is not only a quick read but a wicked blend of both reality and fiction. If you liked The Da Vinci Code, you ll love Paradigm! (Alan (Ace) Greenburg, Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee, Bear Stearns) Almost immediately, I realized this book is reality itself. Reading it was like watching wonderful, complex people on a screen as they move through their extraordinary lives. Paradigm redefines not only how we will view the stock market, but novel writing itself.

Challenging the Innovation Paradigm is a critical analysis of the innovation frenzy and contemporary innovation research. The one-sided focus on desirable effects of innovation misses many opportunities to reduce the undesirable consequences. Authors in this book show how systemic effects outside the innovating firms reduce the net benefits of innovation for individual employees, customers, as well as for society as a whole - also the innovators'' own organizations. This book analyzes the dominant discourses that construct and reconstruct the assumptions and one-sidedness of contemporary innovation research (generally known as the pro-innovation bias) by focusing on consequences of innovation, distinguishing between intended and unintended as well as desirable and undesirable consequences. Contributors illustrate how both the discourses of innovation and the consequences of innovation permeate all levels of society: in policy discourse, in academic discourse, in research funding, in national innovation systems, in the financial sector, in organizational and work contexts, and in environmental pollution. The volume offers a critical, multidisciplinary, and multinational perspective on the topic, with authors from diverse academic fields examining and making comparisons between a variety of national contexts.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RCclYD4f1aoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Challenging the Innovation Paradigm');

Post-process theorists hold that the practice of writing cannot be captured by a generalized process or a "big" theory. Most post-process theorists hold three assumptions about the act of writing: writing is public; writing is interpretive; and writing is situated. The first assumption is the commonsensical claim that writing constitutes a public interchange. By "interpretive act," post-process theorists generally mean something as broad as "making sense of" and not exclusively the ability to move from one code to another. To interpret means more than merely to paraphrase; it means to enter into a relationship of understanding with other language users. And finally, because writing is a public act that requires interpretive interaction with others, writers always write from some position or some place. Writers are never nowhere; they are "situated."

An open source technology that is available on most computer platforms, including Windows® and Mac OS® X, CVS is widely used to manage program code, web site content, and to track changes made to system configuration files. Multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. If two developers modify the same file, CVS enables both sets of changes to be merged together into one final file. Although CVS is a lifesaver in many development scenarios, it suffers from poor documentation. But withEssential CVS, developers can have it all: the order that CVS brings and the comprehensive documentation developers need. Essential CVSis a complete and easy-to-follow reference that helps programmers and system administrators apply order to the task of managing large quantities of documents. The book covers basic concepts and usage of CVS, and features a comprehensive reference for CVS commands--including a handy Command Reference Card for quick, on-the-job checks. The book also includes advanced information on all aspects of CVS that involve automation, logging, branching and merging, and "watches."

The material is informed by, but not limited to, the annual AfterTaste symposia hosted by Parsons The New School of Design. The book''s central argument is that the field of interior design is inadequately served by its historical reliance on taste-making and taste-makers, and, more recently from a set of theoretical concerns derived from architecture; the volume seeks to set an expanded frame by advancing new voices and perspectives in both the theory and practice of interior design, considered as an independent discipline. In 2007, the Department of Architecture, Interior Design and Lighting at Parsons The New School for Design inaugurated an annual international symposium series dedicated to the critical study of the interior. Titled AfterTaste, these yearly symposia offer expansive views of interior studies, highlight emerging areas of research, identify allied practices, make public its under-explored territory, and attract future designers and scholars to the field. Now in its fourth year, AfterTaste has proven to be one of the very few venues internationally for critically exploring interior design. The field of interior design is asymmetrically served by the current literature in the field. Too frequently, the current writing and making in interiors emphasize the ineffable, the biographical, and the social elite, and promote a curiously unsubstantiated notion of connoisseurship as the principal basis for design. Other attempts to construct an intellectual agenda for the study of the interior draw heavily from architectural theory, ignoring the discipline''s own specific and autonomous history. AfterTaste, the book, is intended to adjust this imbalance by introducing interior design material that is theoretically and historically situated, technically grounded, demographically inclusive, and aesthetically adventurous.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a6_tqiTYBBIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'After Taste');

Most countries using the NTSC standard, as well as those using other analog television standards, are switching to newer digital television standards, of which at least four different ones are in use around the world. North America, parts of Central America, and South Korea are adopting the ATSC standards, while other countries are adopting or have adopted other standards. The first NTSC standard was developed in 1941 and had no provision for color television. In 1953 a second modified version of the NTSC standard was adopted, which allowed color television broadcasting compatible with the existing stock of black-and-white receivers. NTSC was the first widely adopted broadcast color system. After nearly 70 years of use, the vast majority of over-the-air NTSC transmissions in the United States were replaced with digital ATSC on June 12, 2009, and will be by August 31, 2011, in Canada in most markets. Despite the shift to digital broadcasting, standard definition television in these countries continues to follow the NTSC standard in terms of frame rate and number of lines of resolution.

They ran, and hid, and then went to work in Orange County''s citrus groves, where, eventually, thousands of fellow Mexican villagers joined them. Gustavo was born sixty years later, the son of a tomato canner who dropped out of school in the ninth grade and an illegal immigrant who snuck into this country in the trunk of a Chevy. Meanwhile, Orange County changed radically, from a bucolic paradise of orange groves to the land where good Republicans go to die, American Christianity blossoms, and way too many bad television shows are green-lit. Part personal narrative, part cultural history, Orange County is the outrageous and true story of the man behind the wildly popular and controversial column ¡Ask a Mexican! and the locale that spawned him. It is a tale of growing up in an immigrant enclave in a crime-ridden neighborhood, but also in a promised land, a place that has nourished America''s soul and Gustavo''s family, both in this country and back in Mexico, for a century. Nationally bestselling author, syndicated columnist, and the spiciest voice of the Mexican-American community, Gustavo Arellano delivers the hilarious and poignant follow-up to ¡Ask a Mexican!, his critically acclaimed debut. Orange County not only weaves Gustavo''s family story with the history of Orange County and the modern Mexican-immigrant experience but also offers sharp, caliente insights into a wide range of political, cultural, and social issues.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4XVNjSWdbDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Orange County');

Fans nationwide have fallen in love with Orange Is the New Black, the critically acclaimed and wildly popular Netflix show based on Piper Kerman’s sensational #1 New York Times bestseller. Now, Catherine Cleary Wolters—the inspiration for Alex Vause, Piper’s ex-girlfriend, friend, and sometimes-romantic partner on the show—tells her true story, offering details and insights that fill in the blanks, set the record straight, and answer common fan questions. An insightful, frustrating, heartbreaking, and uplifting analysis of crime and punishment in our times, Out of Orange is an intimate look at international drug crime—a seemingly glamorous lifestyle that dazzles unsuspecting young women and eventually leads them to the seedy world of prison. Told by a woman originally thrust into the spotlight without her permission—Wolters learned about Piper’s memoir in the media—Out of Orange chronicles Wolter’s time in the drug trade, her incarceration, her friendships and acquaintances with odd cellmates, her two marriages, and her complicated relationship with Piper. But Wolters is not solely defined by her past; she also reflects on her life and the person she is today. Filled with colorful characters, fascinating tales, painful sobering lessons, and hard-earned wisdom, Out of Orange is sure to be provocative, entertaining, and ultimately inspiring.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3SdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Out of Orange');

This study evaluates basswood, red maple, and black willow for making studs using SDR. Results show that basswood and red maple have lower crook when SDR is used with either conventional or high-temperature drying. Black willow crook is lower using SDR but is still much higher than basswood or maple. This poorer performance is believed to be due to wetwood and poor drying. Wrap in wetwood studs is due to wet pockets that are exposed when ripped from the flitches, causing delayed shrinkage after ripping. The percentage of pieces rejected because of warp, based on the STUD grade, is 50-100 percent lower for SDR than for conventionally sawed studs.

It provides a basis for integrating energy efficiency and solar approaches in ways that will allow building owners and designers to balance the need to minimize initial costs, operating costs, and life-cycle costs with need to maintain reliable building operations and enhance environmental quality both inside and outside the building. Chapters trace the development of building energy systems and analyze the demand side of solar applications as a means for determining what portion of a building''s energy requirements can potentially be met by solar energy.Following the introduction, the book provides an overview of energy use patterns in the aggregate U.S. building population. Chapter 3 surveys work on the energy flows in an individual building and shows how these flows interact to influence overall energy use. Chapter 4 presents the analytical methods, techniques, and tools developed to calculate and analyze energy use in buildings, while chapter 5 provides an extensive survey of the energy conservation and management strategies developed in the post-energy crisis period.The approach taken is a commonsensical one, starting with the proposition that the purpose of buildings is to house human activities, and that conservation measures that negatively affect such activities are based on false economies. The goal is to determine rational strategies for the design of new buildings, and the retrofit of existing buildings to bring them up to modern standards of energy use.

The last few years have experienced a steep growth in research in the area of wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The attractiveness of WMNs, in general, is attributed to their characteristics such as the ability to dynamically self-organize and self-con?gure, coupled with the ability to maintain mesh connectivity leading, in effect, to low set-up/installation costs, simpler maintenance tasks, and service coverage with high reliability and fault-tolerance. WMNs also support their integration with existing wireless networks such as cellular networks, WLANs, wireless-?delity (Wi-Fi), and worldwide interoperability of microwave access (WiMAX). WMNs have found u- ful applications in a broad range of domains such as broadband home networking, commercial/business networking, and community networking – particularly attr- tive in offering broadband wireless access with low initial installation and set-up costs. Even though WMNs have emerged to be attractive and they hold great promises for our future, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. Some of the wellknownchallenges areattributedtoissuesrelatingtoscalability(signi?cantdrop in throughput with the increase in the number of nodes), multicasting, offering qu- ity of service guarantees, energy ef?ciency, and security. This handbook attempts to provide a comprehensive guide on fundamental key topics coupled with new ideas and results in the areas of WMNs. The book has been prepared keeping in mind that it needs to prove itself to be a valuable resource dealing with both the important core and the specialized issues in WMNs.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k8y54FSMLMEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Guide to Wireless Mesh Networks');

Addressing contemporary issues like land use, water rights, dramatic population increases, suburban sprawl, and the US-Mexico border, the new material makes the book more essential than ever. It successfully places the forty-eighth state''s history within the context of national and global events. No other book on Arizona history is as integrative or comprehensive. From stone spear points more than 10,000 years old to the boom and bust of the housing market in the first decade of this century, Arizona: A History explores the ways in which Native Americans, Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and Anglos have inhabited and exploited Arizona. Sheridan, a life-long resident of the state, puts forth new ideas about what a history should be, embracing a holistic view of the region and shattering the artificial line between prehistory and history. Other works on Arizona''s history focus on government, business, or natural resources, but this is the only book to meld the ethnic and cultural complexities of the state''s history into the main flow of the story.

insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('The crystal engineering of inorganic-organic hybrid materials, nominally metal organic frameworks and coordination polymers, has become an increasingly popular field of research over the past few decades owing to the potential for the synthesis of technologically important compounds with tailored topologies. These materials consist of metal centers tethered through multifunctional organic linkers to promote higher dimensional compounds. As such, self-assembly under hydrothermal conditions has been employed to synthesize extended dimensional homometallic and heterometallic actinide based coordination polymers. The uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) metal centers in these materials showed an affinity towards binding with the ligand in a bidentate fashion through a carboxylate oxygen atom and nitrogen from a heterocyclic aromatic forming a 5-membered ring. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the uranium based coordination polymers were investigated. The fluorescence of hexavalent uranium in both solution and the solid state is known to derive from vibronic transitions of the central uranyl moiety, UO22+. Upon excitation of the uranyl cation, the characteristic emission between 450-600 nm results from the symmetric stretching of the O=U bond with known vibronic frequency of 860 cm-1. The frequencies for the homometallic materials were calculated to range from 862-894 cm-1 agreeing with the literature value of 860 cm-1. The pyridinedicarboxylic acid series illustrated a fascinating feature in the emission spectra: shoulder peaks. Attempts to correlate the shoulder peaks with the geometric nature of the uranyl cation in each compound are presented herein. When the uranyl cation was excited in the heterometallic compounds within the 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid systems, the characteristic emission was not detected. This observation indicates that the copper (II) metal centers may provide an alternative pathway for non-radiative decay. In compound 13, the copper and uranium metal centers are bridged through a uranyl oxygen atom. This change in the uranyl environment may also contribute to the lack of detectable uranyl emission. Conversely, uranyl emission was observed when either copper (II) or lead (II) was incorporated into the uranium-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid system (compounds 8 and 11). This occurrence may be the first instance where uranyl emission was observed in the presence of a transition metal in the solid state. These photophysical properties along with the structural schematics of the various systems will be discussed.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGKeGhZfzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Controlling the Hydrothermal Conditions to Synthesize Novel Uranium-based Heterometallic Coordination Polymers and Their Subsequent Fluorescence Investigations');

They ran, and hid, and then went to work in Orange County''s citrus groves, where, eventually, thousands of fellow Mexican villagers joined them. Gustavo was born sixty years later, the son of a tomato canner who dropped out of school in the ninth grade and an illegal immigrant who snuck into this country in the trunk of a Chevy. Meanwhile, Orange County changed radically, from a bucolic paradise of orange groves to the land where good Republicans go to die, American Christianity blossoms, and way too many bad television shows are green-lit. Part personal narrative, part cultural history, Orange County is the outrageous and true story of the man behind the wildly popular and controversial column ¡Ask a Mexican! and the locale that spawned him. It is a tale of growing up in an immigrant enclave in a crime-ridden neighborhood, but also in a promised land, a place that has nourished America''s soul and Gustavo''s family, both in this country and back in Mexico, for a century. Nationally bestselling author, syndicated columnist, and the spiciest voice of the Mexican-American community, Gustavo Arellano delivers the hilarious and poignant follow-up to ¡Ask a Mexican!, his critically acclaimed debut.

My hope is that practitioners will take to heart the book''s call for critical self-reflection and use its insights for more effective policy prescriptions. Wonderfully written, the book delivers a cool but passionate analysis, born from Autesserre''s courage, commitment to Congolese, and sincere desire not to simply identify criticisms of peacebuilding but to suggest ways in which it can improve its craft to help the people on the ground."-Michael Barnett, University of Minnesota "What happens when international peacebuilding is culturally focused at the national level, yet most conflict takes place at the local level? Using extensive, painstakingly collected evidence, Autesserre shows that the macro-micro mismatch is not only a methodological shortcoming but also a grave policy failure. By helping to frame a nasty concatenation of local conflicts as a ''postconflict situation,'' this policy focus ended up exacerbating the war and its attendant human suffering. At once a gripping account of war and failed peace in the Congo and a strikingly lucid and original examination of the causes of peacebuilding failure in civil war, this book demonstrates why deep contextual knowledge remains an essential precondition of theoretical innovation."-Stathis N. Kalyvas, Yale University "Autesserre''s book stands as a major contribution to our understanding of the roots of conflict in eastern Congo and the failure of the UN Mission in the Congo (MONUC) to effectively restore peace. She develops a highly original and theoretically innovative framework for reconceptualizing both the nature of conflict in eastern Congo and how to deal with it. This book will be read with considerable interest, and no little trepidation, by UN officials and international peacemakers in general, as well as by students of international relations and African politics."-RenT Lemarchand, University of Florida "This is a disturbing book about a failure that is not acknowledged as a failure, about intervention strategies that do not address key sources of deadly violence, and about the trained incapacity of diplomats who look solely to national agreements and processes to end longstanding wars.

In this Council Special Report, commissioned by the Center for Preventive Action, Anthony W. Gambino analyzes these problems and proposes steps the United States can take to help. He details the country''s social, economic, and security challenges, ranging from lawlessness and corruption to poverty and poor health. He then recommends two priorities for U.S. policy: combating insecurity in the east and promoting sustainable development. To bolster security, the report urges the United States to ensure that the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC has an appropriate mandate and sufficient personnel and resources to remain in place for the foreseeable future, at least through the planned 2011 elections.

This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you''ve already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book''s companion web site. The rules include how to: Make Fewer HTTP Requests Use a Content Delivery Network Add an Expires Header Gzip Components Put Stylesheets at the Top Put Scripts at the Bottom Avoid CSS Expressions Make JavaScript and CSS External Reduce DNS Lookups Minify JavaScript Avoid Redirects Remove Duplicates Scripts Configure ETags Make Ajax Cacheable If you''re building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable.

Lennart Jorelid''s book concentrates on teaching programmers how to fit the various technologies together while spending as little time as possible on "plumbing." Jorelid discusses servlet development and architecture, and he teaches developers how to integrate servlets into distributed enterprise systems with illustrated examples. He explains the architecture and implementation of JSPs—including introductory concepts such as using all built-in facilities of the JSP library and advanced topics such as creating your own custom actions using the JSP Tag Library API. Jorelid also addresses the open-source Struts framework from the Apache Software Foundation, which provides a powerful framework for J2EE Web application development by combining servlets and JSPs. And, finally, Jorelid explores the EJB programming paradigm, covering development and architecture of EJBs and J2EE integration and deployment.

Three major classes of optic flow computation techniques can discriminated (see for a good overview Beauchemin and Barron IBeauchemin19951): gradient based (or differential) methods; phase based (or frequency domain) methods; correlation based (or area) methods; feature point (or sparse data) tracking methods; In this chapter we compute the optic flow as a dense optic flow field with a multi scale differential method. The method, originally proposed by Florack and Nielsen [Florack1998a] is known as the Multiscale Optic Flow Constrain Equation (MOFCE). This is a scale space version of the well known computer vision implementation of the optic flow constraint equation, as originally proposed by Horn and Schunck [Horn1981]. This scale space variation, as usual, consists of the introduction of the aperture of the observation in the process. The application to stereo has been described by Maas et al. [Maas 1995a, Maas 1996a]. Of course, difficulties arise when structure emerges or disappears, such as with occlusion, cloud formation etc. Then knowledge is needed about the processes and objects involved. In this chapter we focus on the scale space approach to the local measurement of optic flow, as we may expect the visual front end to do. 17. 2 Motion detection with pairs of receptive fields As a biologically motivated start, we begin with discussing some neurophysiological findings in the visual system with respect to motion detection.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JaMSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Front-End Vision and Multi-Scale Image Analysis');

Development of radio frequency ICs Wireless communications has been advancing rapidly in the past two decades. Many high performance systems have been developed, such as cellular systems (AMPS, GSM, TDMA, CDMA, W-CDMA, etc. ), GPS system (global po- tioning system) and WLAN (wireless local area network) systems. The rapid growth of VLSI technology in both digital circuits and analog circuits provides benefits for wireless communication systems. Twenty years ago not many p- ple could imagine millions of transistors in a single chip or a complete radio for size of a penny. Now not only complete radios have been put in a single chip, but also more and more functions have been realized by a single chip and at a much lower price. A radio transmits and receives electro-magnetic signals through the air. The signals are usually transmitted on high frequency carriers. For example, a t- ical voice signal requires only 30 Kilohertz bandwidth. When it is transmitted by a FM radio station, it is often carried by a frequency in the range of tens of megahertz to hundreds of megahertz. Usually a radio is categorized by its carrier frequency, such as 900 MHz radio or 5 GHz radio. In general, the higher the carrier frequency, the better the directivity, but the more difficult the radio design.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXJCAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'High-Linearity CMOS RF Front-End Circuits');

In America''s Strategy in World Politics, Spykman examined world politics from a realist geopolitical perspective. The United States, he explained, was fighting for its very survival as an independent country because the conquests of Germany and Japan raised the specter of our geopolitical encirclement by hostile forces controlling the power centers of Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. Spykman warned that the United States could not safely retreat to a defensive position in the Western Hemisphere. Spykman looked beyond the immediate strategic requirements of the Second World War, envisioning a postwar world in which the United States would help shape the global balance of power to meet its security needs. Even though Soviet Russia was our wartime ally, Spykman recognized that a geopolitically unbalanced Soviet Union could threaten to upset the postwar balance of power and thereby endanger U.S. security. Spykman also foresaw the rise of China in postwar Asia, and the likely need for the United States to ally itself with Japan to balance China''s power. He also recognized that the Middle East would play a pivotal role in the postwar world. Spykman influenced American postwar statesmen and strategists. During the Cold War, the U.S. sought to deny the Soviet Union political control of Western Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia.

Hall effect sensors, based on a magnetic phenomena, are one of the most commonly used sensing technologies today. In the 1970s it became possible to build Hall effect sensors on integrated circuits with onboard signal processing circuitry, vastly reducing the cost and enabling widespread practical use. One of the first major applications was in computer keyboards, replacing mechanical contacts. Hundreds of millions of these devices are now manufactured each year for use in a great variety of applications, including automobiles, computers, industrial control systems, cell phones, and many others. The importance of these sensors, however, contrasts with the limited information available. Many recent advances in miniaturization, smart sensor configurations, and networkable sensor technology have led to design changes and a need for reliable information. Most of the technical information on Hall effect sensors is supplied by sensor manufacturers and is slanted toward a particular product line. System design and control engineers need an independent, readable source of practical design information and technical details that is not product- or manufacturer-specific and that shows how Hall effect sensors work, how to interface to them, and how to apply them in a variety of uses. This book covers: • the physics behind Hall effect sensors • Hall effect transducers • transducer interfacing • integrated Hall effect sensors and how to interface to them • sensing techniques using Hall effect sensors • application-specific sensor ICs • relevant development and design tools This second edition is expanded and updated to reflect the latest advances in Hall effect devices and applications! Information about various sensor technologies is scarce, scattered and hard to locate. Most of it is either too theoretical for working engineers, or is manufacturer literature that can’t be entirely trusted. Engineers and engineering managers need a comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate reference to use when scoping out their designs incorporating Hall effect sensors. * A comprehensive, up-to-date reference to use when crafting all kinds of designs with Hall effect sensors *Replaces other information about sensors that is too theoretical, too biased toward one particular manufacturer, or too difficult to locate *Highly respected and influential author in the burgeoning sensors community', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R8VAjMitH1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Hall-Effect Sensors');

Author and physics teacher Bobby Mercer will show readers 25 easy-to-build racecars that can be driven both indoors and out. Better still, each of these vehicles is constructed for little or no cost using recycled and repurposed materials. The Racecar Book will teach readers how to use mousetraps, rubber bands, chemical reactions, gravity, and air pressure to power these fast-moving cars. They will learn how to turn a potato chip can, a rubber band, and weights into a Chip-Can Dancer, or retrofit a toy car with a toy plane propeller to make an air-powered Prop Car. An effervescent tablet in a small canister makes an impressive rocket engine for a Mini Pop Car, and old CDs, a small cardboard food box, and drinking straws become a Mac-n-Cheese Roller. Every hands-on project contains a materials list and detailed step-by-step instructions. Mercer also includes explanations of the science behind each racecar, including concepts such as friction, Newton’s laws of motion, kinetic and potential energy, and more. Teachers will appreciate the opportunity to augment their STEM curricula while having fun at the same time. These projects are also perfect for science fairs or design competitions.

It is also a subject of great mathematical beauty. In consequence of both of these facts, linear algebra has increasingly been brought into lower levels of the curriculum, either in conjunction with the calculus or separate from it but at the same level. A large and still growing number of textbooks has been written to satisfy this need, aimed at students at the junior, sophomore, or even freshman levels. Thus, most students now obtaining a bachelor''s degree in the sciences or engineering have had some exposure to linear algebra. But rarely, even when solid courses are taken at the junior or senior levels, do these students have an adequate working knowledge of the subject to be useful in graduate work or in research and development activities in government and industry. In particular, most elementary courses stop at the point of canonical forms, so that while the student may have "seen" the Jordan and other canonical forms, there is usually little appreciation of their usefulness. And there is almost never time in the elementary courses to deal with more specialized topics like nonnegative matrices, inertia theorems, and so on.

The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. They begin with a review and discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following chapters each treat a major topic in depth. This volume should be useful not only as a text, but also as a self-contained reference work to a variety of audiences in other scientific fields.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PlYQN0ypTwEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Matrix Analysis');

In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie’ s special and widely hailed literary mastery.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LUSXbXK-Ue8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Castles of Steel');

Companies have therefore identified process agility as a competitive advantage to address business trends like increasing product and service variability or faster time to market, and to ensure business IT alignment. Along this trend, a new generation of information systems has emerged—so-called process-aware information systems (PAIS), like workflow management systems, case handling tools, and service orchestration engines. With this book, Reichert and Weber address these flexibility needs and provide an overview of PAIS with a strong focus on methods and technologies fostering flexibility for all phases of the process lifecycle (i.e., modeling, configuration, execution and evolution). Their presentation is divided into six parts. Part I starts with an introduction of fundamental PAIS concepts and establishes the context of process flexibility in the light of practical scenarios. Part II focuses on flexibility support for pre-specified processes, the currently predominant paradigm in the field of business process management (BPM). Part III details flexibility support for loosely specified processes, which only partially specify the process model at build-time, while decisions regarding the exact specification of certain model parts are deferred to the run-time. Part IV deals with user- and data-driven processes, which aim at a tight integration of processes and data, and hence enable an increased flexibility compared to traditional PAIS. Part V introduces existing technologies and systems for the realization of a flexible PAIS. Finally, Part VI summarizes the main ideas of this book and gives an outlook on advanced flexibility issues. The book’s target groups include researchers, PhD students and Master students in the field of information systems. After reading the book, they will better understand PAIS flexibility aspects. To support the easy use as a textbook, a series of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter and slides and further teaching material are available on the book’s web site www.flexible-processes.com. Professionals specializing in business process management (BPM) who want to obtain a good understanding of flexibility challenges in BPM and state-of-the-art solutions will also benefit from the presentations of open source as well as commercial process management systems and related practical scenarios.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8OGSMB81G-IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Enabling Flexibility in Process-Aware Information Systems');

Patients now legally can write advance directives to govern their treatment decisions at a time of future incapacity, yet in clinical practice their wishes often are ignored. Examining the tension between incompetent patients'' prior wishes and their current best interests as well as other challenges to advance directives, Robert S. Olick offers a comprehensive argument for favoring advance instructions during the dying process. He clarifies widespread confusion about the moral and legal weight of advance directives, and he prescribes changes in law, policy, and practice that would not only ensure that directives count in the care of the dying but also would define narrow instances when directives should not be followed. Olick also presents and develops an original theory of prospective autonomy that recasts and strengthens patient and family control. While focusing largely on philosophical issues the book devotes substantial attention to legal and policy questions and includes case studies throughout. An important resource for medical ethicists, lawyers, physicians, nurses, health care professionals, and patients'' rights advocates, it champions the practical, ethical, and humane duty of taking advance directives seriously where it matters most-at the bedside of dying patients.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AcIpW6sysS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Taking Advance Directives Seriously');

In one easy-to-use volume it provides: 1. the texts of the Public Sector Directive and the Utilities Directive, with the articles of these directives linked to the relevant Court of Justice case law; 2. in-depth analysis of 84 judgements rendered by the Court of Justice in connection with subject matter treated by the articles of the two directives; 3. the essential excerpts from the chronologically ordered judgments, with each excerpt preceded by an overview of the subject matter and points of law treated in the judgment; 4. pertinent passages of opinions of the Advocate General; 5. texts of supplementary legislation, including the relevant articles of the EC Treaty and interpretative communications and explanatory notes of the European Commission; and 6. an exhaustive subject index. By bringing the reader into direct contact with the relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice - which has been instrumental in interpreting the public procurement legal framework - the book clearly manifests the reality of public procurement in the European Union.

Ms. Quinlan''s case contained nearly all the elements of the problems we still face: vague, general, but sincere prior oral statements suggesting that she would not want continued treatment; a family attempting to do what they saw as best for her; and physicians uncertain whether to use medical judgment alone (and if so, what the "right" medical decision was), to preserve her life at all costs, or to honor the family''s interpretation of their daughter''s choice. Most ironically, once she was removed from her respirator, she did not die. Karen Quinlan - like dozens of other names made famous by court decisions, newspaper stories, and television evening news - has come to symbolize a tangled knot of issues surrounding the end of life and who controls it.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Q8rBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Making Sense of Advance Directives');

A patient''s right to self-determination becomes a poignant and volatile issue in the context of modern life-sustaining technologies. When the benefit of medical treatment is overshadowed by the resulting burdens, treatment may ethically be withdrawn. Patients have the right to make this decision, assuming they still have the capacity to make it. Through advance directives a competent patient can extend his right to consent to or refuse medical treatment indefinitely into the future. Whether in the form of informal oral instructions or formal written documents, advance directives insure patients that their treatment wishes will be carried out. They also alleviate the uncertainty, guilt, and/or fear of legal consequences facing the family and caregivers. This volume is a collection of fourteen essays investigating the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of directives, the role of professionals in making and honoring them, policy issues that need to be addressed, and future directions which directives may take. Although such documents may be used to request treatment, this volume limits its focus to their more common function . . . the refusal of treatment. Timely and comprehensive, Advance Directives in Medicine provides a stimulating overview of this relevant topic. The papers in this volume were originally presented at a multidisciplinary conference on advance directives. Revised and edited for this text, they address a variety of questions and issues, for instance: What are the individual and societal benefits of advance directives? Does an advance directive tamper with the sanctity of life? Will normalizing directives have an adverse effect on the practice of medicine? Should a patient specify treatments to be withheld within a directive, such as the use of CPR, nutrition, or hydration? What legal sanctions should apply against those who ignore directives? Should directives be used to reduce health care expenditures by insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid? What is a physician''s role in helping his patient formulate an appropriate directive and when is a patient ready to confront his own mortality?', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KEIQAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'Advance directives in medicine');

Ward shows that Iran''s soldiers, from the famed "Immortals" of ancient Persia to today''s Revolutionary Guard, have demonstrated through the centuries that they should not be underestimated. This history also provides background on the nationalist, tribal, and religious heritages of the country to help readers better understand Iran and its security outlook. "Immortal" begins with the founding of ancient Persia''s empire under Cyrus the Great and continues through the Iran-Iraq War (1980--1988) and up to the present. Drawing on a wide range of sources including declassified documents, the author gives primary focus to the modern era to relate the build-up of the military under the last Shah, its collapse during the Islamic revolution, its fortunes in the Iran-Iraq War, and its rise from the ashes to help Iran become once again a major regional military power. He shows that, despite command and supply problems, Iranian soldiers demonstrate high levels of bravery and perseverance and have enjoyed surprising tactical successes even when victory has been elusive. These qualities and the Iranians'' ability to impose high costs on their enemies by exploiting Iran''s imposing geography bear careful consideration today by potential opponents.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8eUTLaaVOOQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Immortal');

This collection of essays presents a comprehensive study of the social and historical development of the Baha’i community, and its role in shaping modern Iran. Central to this study is the pioneering character of the Baha’i community in the late 19thand early 20thcentury, with chapters examining the role of women in the Baha’i community; the impact of Baha’i-run schools on Iranian society, Baha’i contributions to public health initiatives; and the influence of Baha’i thought and the actions of individual Baha’is on the Constitutional Revolution of 1906-1911. Conversion to the Baha’i Faith is another important theme, as contributors investigate the phenomenon of large scale conversion to the Baha’i Faith from the Jewish and Zoroastrian communities. Finally, although persecution of the Baha’is has drawn the attention of the Western media, until now few scholars working in the field of Iranian studies have chosen to write on the history or details of this persecution. Here, five prominent figures in the field redress this balance and look at different aspects of this persecution, including its historical background, the attitude of secular Iranians, persecution before and after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, and human rights perspectives. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of Iranian studies, Middle Eastern studies and comparative religion, and with many chapters authored by leading academics in Iranian studies, The Baha’is of Iran addresses both a gap in academic literature on the Baha’i Faith, and in the study of modern Iran in general.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p3nWI_CzuX8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Baha''is of Iran');

Sella''s images of the mountainous terrain of five continents are some of the most breathtaking and beautiful images of their kind ever taken - as well as astonishing feats from a technical point of view. From a twenty-first century standpoint, they possess an additional power to move the viewer that Sella could not have foreseen, constituting a salutary reminder of the fragility of such landscapes and the threats they face in our modern world. Although Sella''s visit to Britain in 1892 resulted in a near-death experience (an accident in a train leaving him with a fractured skull) England, and in particular, London, was to be a key reference point for him throughout his career. His knowledge of the language was sufficient for him to correspond in English, his beautiful, largescale view cameras were ordered from and made in London and his photographs were distributed for sale from the capital. London also played its part in fostering Sella''s reputation during his own lifetime. His work was recognised by institutions such as the Alpine Club, the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Photographic Society. In addition, important books of his photographs were published here, including Douglas Freshfield''s The Exploration of the Caucasus of 1896 and Filippo De Filippi''s account of the Duke of the Abruzzi''s expedition to the Karakoram and the western Himalayas in 1909, as well as the first biography of Sella. Although this reintroduction of Sella to London is long overdue, its timing is perhaps auspicious, on the cusp of the 150th anniversary of his birth next year. Our thanks for making it possible go to Mark Haworth-Booth for his advice and efforts and, of course, to Lodovico and Angelica Sella at the Fondazione Sella in Biella both for their kindness in lending the works that form this exhibition and for all their work in ensuring its realisation. Finally, as ever, I am grateful to all the staff at the Estorick Collection, Harry Hare in particular for his passion for the subject, and everybody who has devoted so much energy and enthusiasm to this project.

With its gentle approach to working with the spine, the skull and its cranial sutures, diaphragms, and fascia, CST has proven equally useful for physical therapists, massage therapists, naturopaths, chiropractors, and osteopaths. One reason for its success has been its underlying theory, as explained by CST pioneer John Upledger.

The book offers simple strategies for treating disease and dysfunction by communicating with these cells to uncover the memories and then follow the healing path they suggest. Upledger blends the scientific aspects of cell biology with insights into the nature of inner consciousness, in the process uncovering the deep links between physiology, energy, health, and healing.

While most of these organizations have no direct connection to human rights issues, their participation in broader IGO networks has important implications for the human rights practices of their member states. Featuring a rigorous empirical analysis, Transmitting Rights shows that countries tend to adopt similar human rights practices to those of their IGO partners, whether for better or worse. Greenhill argues that IGOs constitute a tightly-woven fabric of ties between states and that this network provides an important channel through which states can influence the behavior of others. Indeed, his analysis suggests that a policy of isolating "rogue" states is probably self-defeating given that this will reduce their exposure to some of the more positive IGO-based influences on their human rights. Greenhill''s analysis of the role of IGOs in rights diffusion will not only increase our understanding of the international politics of human rights; it will also reshape how we think about the role of international institutions in world politics.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wXYRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Transmitting Rights');

Although there are no known examples of arch dams which have been seriously damaged by earthquakes, the need for more realistic seismic analyses is now well recognized, not only for new dams but especially in the context of the safety evaluation of existing dams. Fortunately, with the finite element method, engineers have a powerful tool for modeling the complex geometry and the nonlinear material behavior of a dam. However, there is still a major complication in the analysis procedure, namely the interaction of the dam with the reservoir and with the foundation during an earthquake. Interaction is a wave propagation problem involving transmitting boundaries. The State of the Art in engineering practice is to neglect wave propagation by modeling the water as incompressible and the foundation as massless. More advanced analysis methods using compressible water and foundation with mass have been available for some time. However, these methods are restricted to linear models, because they work in the frequency domain. On the other hand, there are also advanced nonlinear models for dams, but they can only be used in the time domain, usually with simple transmitting boundaries. In this report, which is based on an a doctoral thesis, rigorous transmitting boundaries in the time domain are developed which permit combining compressible water with n- linear dam behavior.

Yet, despite the proliferation of new modalities of regulating infrastructure little is known about what works and why. Why do certain regulatory regimes fail and others succeed? What regulatory designs and institutional features produce optimal outcomes and how? And why do regulatory forms of governance when transplanted into different institutional contexts produce less than uniform outcomes?

This volume is the culmination of an unprecedented effort to document, analyze, and interpret the full extent of the challenge in developing Sub-Saharan Africa s infrastructure sectors. As a result, it represents the most comprehensive reference currently available on infrastructure in the region. The book covers the five main economic infrastructure sectors information and communication technology, irrigation, power, transport, and water and sanitation. ''Africa s Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation'' reflects the collaboration of a wide array of African regional institutions and development partners under the auspices of the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa. It presents the findings of the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD), a project launched following a commitment in 2005 by the international community (after the G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland) to scale up financial support for infrastructure development in Africa. The lack of reliable information in this area made it difficult to evaluate the success of past interventions, prioritize current allocations, and provide benchmarks for measuring future progress, hence the need for the AICD. Africa s infrastructure sectors lag well behind those of the rest of the world, and the gap is widening. Some of the main policy-relevant findings highlighted in the book include the following: infrastructure in the region is exceptionally expensive, with tariffs being many times higher than those found elsewhere. Inadequate and expensive infrastructure is retarding growth by 2 percentage points each year. Solving the problem will cost over US$90 billion per year, which is more than twice what is being spent in Africa today. However, money alone is not the answer. Prudent policies, wise management, and sound maintenance can improve efficiency, thereby stretching the infrastructure dollar. There is the potential to recover an additional US$17 billion a year from within the existing infrastructure resource envelope simply by improving efficiency. For example, improved revenue collection and utility management could generate US$3.3 billion per year. Regional power trade could reduce annual costs by US$2 billion. And deregulating the trucking industry could reduce freight costs by one-half. So, raising more funds without also tackling inefficiencies would be like pouring water into a leaking bucket. Finally, the power sector and fragile states represent particular challenges. Even if every efficiency in every infrastructure sector could be captured, a substantial funding gap of $31 billion a year would remain. Nevertheless, the African people and economies cannot wait any longer.

The paper notes that macro and industry level research , although having its limitations, suggest a positive and statistically significant relationship between infrastructure and economic output. However the conclusions derived from this research (most of which derives from developed countries) provide little specific guidance for policy. To gain more practical insights about how infrastructure contributes to economic growth and to improved quality of life, and to understand the welfare costs of inadequate or unreliable infrastructure, it is necessary to look at microeconomic evidence. Particularly interesting illustrations of these relationships are to be found in developing countries where there is wide variance in the availability and quality of infrastructure.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOH0ra5QaoMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Contributions of Infrastructure to Economic Development');

Data from this study have provided new insights on the extent of a power crisis in the region, characterized by insufficient capacity, low electricity connection rates, high costs, and poor reliabilityùand on what can be done about it. The continent faces an annual power sector financing gap of about $21 billion, with much of the existing spending channeled to maintain and operate high-cost power systems, leaving little for the huge investments needed to provide a long-term solution. Meanwhile, the power crisis is taking a heavy toll on economic growth and productivity. This book asserts that the current impediments to economic growth and development need to be tackled through policies and investment strategies that renew efforts to reform state-owned utilities, build on the lessons of private participation in infrastructure projects, retarget electrification strategies, expand regional power trade, and mobilize new funding resources. Further development of regional power trade would allow Africa to harness larger-scale and more cost-effective energy sources, reducing energy system costs by US$2 billion and carbon dioxide emissions by 70 million tons annually. But reaping the promise of regional trade depends on a handful of major exporting countries raising the large volumes of finance needed to develop generation capacity for export; it also requires a large number of importing countries to muster the requisite political will. With increased utility efficiency and regional power trade in play, power costs would fall and full cost recovery tariffs could become affordable in much of Africa. This will make utilities more creditworthy and help sustain the flow of external finance to the sector, which is essential to close the huge financing gap.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPasSxcQ858C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Africa''s Power Infrastructure');

But a century into our love affair with plastic, we’re starting to realize it’s not such a healthy relationship. Plastics draw on dwindling fossil fuels, leach harmful chemicals, litter landscapes, and destroy marine life. As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we’re nearing a crisis point. We’ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card. Her conclusion: we cannot stay on our plastic-paved path. And we don’t have to. Plastic points the way toward a new creative partnership with the material we love to hate but can’t seem to live without.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9LyGHqqIKT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Plastic');

In the summer of 1997, Charles Moore set sail from Honolulu with the sole intention of returning home after competing in a trans-Pacific race. To get to California, he and his crew took a shortcut through the seldom-traversed North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a vast "oceanic desert" where winds are slack and sailing ships languish. There, Moore realized his catamaran was surrounded by a "plastic soup." He had stumbled upon the largest garbage dump on the planet-a spiral nebula where plastic outweighed zooplankton, the ocean''s food base, by a factor of six to one. In Plastic Ocean, Moore recounts his ominous findings and unveils the secret life and hidden properties of plastics. From milk jugs to polymer molecules small enough to penetrate human skin or be unknowingly inhaled, plastic is now suspected of contributing to a host of ailments including infertility, autism, thyroid dysfunction, and some cancers. A call to action as urgent as Rachel Carson''s seminal Silent Spring, Moore''s sobering revelations will be embraced by activists, concerned parents, and seafaring enthusiasts concerned about the deadly impact and implications of this man made blight.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SLyAg4qJvOQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Plastic Ocean');

And like a broken phone or TV remote, they throw prayer out as unnecessary ''clutter'' in their busy lives. Anne Graham Lotz has found that while prayer does work, sometimes the ''pray-ers'' don''t. So she has turned to the prophet Daniel for help. The Daniel Prayer is born deep within your soul, erupts through your heart, and pours out on your lips - words created by and infused with the Spirit of God, quivering with spiritual electricity. It''s really not an everyday type of prayer. It''s a prayer birthed under pressure, sometimes heartache or grief. It can be triggered by a sudden revelation of hope: an answer to prayer, a promise freshly received, a miracle that lies just over the horizon... This book will help you to pray - effectively - for your nation, for your family, and for yourself. In it, Anne answers such questions as... Does God only hear the prayers of good people? How do I know the God to whom I pray will listen? How do I know God cares about my prayer? How do I know God will answer my prayer? Why should I pray at all? Does it matter where I am when I pray? Are words in prayer all that matter, or does my attitude affect prayer? And most crucial of all - what difference does my prayer actually make?

If so, you aren’t alone. According to a January 2010 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, there are 609.8 million credit cards held by U.S. consumers, and the average credit card debt per household is $15,519. In the last 12 months, 15 percent of American adults, or nearly 34 million people, have been late making a credit card payment, and 8 percent (18 million people) have missed a payment entirely, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. If these statistics hit home for you, don’t turn to bankruptcy to solve your financial woes. This book will provide you with the tools to legally settle your credit card accounts — without ruining your financial situation for years to come. How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar is for everyone who is unable to pay mounting minimum payments on their credit cards. You will learn everything you need to know about the basics of credit card debt, including interest rates, finance charges, minimum payments, and late fees. Discover what actually happens to your credit when you are late making your payments or stop making payments altogether and how long it takes before your credit cards debt is sold to a collection agency. This book will provide tips and strategies for negotiating with your original creditor and collection agencies and sample settlement letters you can use when working with creditors. Equip yourself with proven strategies for legally challenging the validity of your credit card debt and information on how to determine whether your rights are being violated under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You will find out the advantages of not filing bankruptcy and how to work with credit counselors and avoid debt-reduction scams. Once you have successfully settled your debt and avoided bankruptcy, you will learn how to avoid repeating these mistakes in the future by setting budgets, cutting costs, and lowering interest rates. Learn how the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which went into effect in February 2010, affects you as a consumer. While these new rules do not absolve consumers of their obligations, they do mean that credit card companies can no longer retroactively increase rates, charge misleading late fees, or use over-limit fee traps. We have spent hundreds of hours interviewing top financial experts, bill collectors, and individuals just like you who were able to legally settle their credit card debt without resorting to bankruptcy. If you are tired of dodging phone calls from collectors or worrying about how missed payments have ruined your credit score, get yourself back to a more stable financial situation — one where credit card debt is a thing of the past.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5lUh_vDLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar');

But as Richard Iton shows in this provocative and insightful volume, despite the changes brought about by the civil rights movement, and contrary to the wishes of those committed to narrower conceptions of politics, black artists have continued to play a significant role in the making and maintenance of critical social spaces. Iton offers an original portrait of the relationship between popular culture and institutionalized politics tracing the connections between artists such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Pryor, Bob Marley, and Erykah Badu and those individuals working in the protest, electoral, and policy making arenas. With an emphasis on questions of class, gender and sexuality-and diaspora and coloniality-the author also illustrates how creative artists destabilize modern notions of the proper location of politics, and politics itself. Ranging from theater to film, and comedy to literature and contemporary music, In Search of the Black Fantastic is an engaging and sophisticated examination of how black popular culture has challenged our understandings of the aesthetic and its relationship to politics.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=An3xv7mXeQAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'In Search of the Black Fantastic');

Born under the shadow of the bomb, with little security but the cold comfort of duck-and-cover, the postwar generations lived through—and led—some of the most momentous changes in all of American history. Hales explores those decades through perceptive accounts of a succession of resonant moments, spaces, and artifacts of everyday life—drawing unexpected connections and tracing the intertwined undercurrents of promise and peril. From sharp analyses of newsreels of the first atomic bomb tests and the invention of a new ideal American life in Levittown; from the music emerging from the Brill Building and the Beach Boys, and a brilliant account of Bob Dylan’s transformations; from the painful failures of communes and the breathtaking utopian potential of the early days of the digital age, Hales reveals a nation, and a dream, in transition, as a new generation began to make its mark on the world it was inheriting. Full of richly drawn set-pieces and countless stories of unforgettable moments, Outside the Gates of Eden is the most comprehensive account yet of the baby boomers, their parents, and their children, as seen through the places they built, the music and movies and shows they loved, and the battles they fought to define their nation, their culture, and their place in what remains a fragile and dangerous world.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NohFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Outside the Gates of Eden');

Having achieved everything she thought she’d ever wanted, Vanessa quickly learnt that success often comes at a great deal of personal cost and compromise. The constant battling and accomplishment of the ultimate grand prize eventually took its toll and drastically altered her definition of ‘success’, encouraging a life-changing move in a new direction. From periods of glittering success to near total derailment, Heels of Steel unveils the truth behind a woman’s climb to success in the male dominated City world. You are invited to follow her journey as she scales (and slips up and down) the corporate ladder, digging her heels in to avoid being absorbed by the politics and alpha male behaviour still prevalent in so many corporate environments. A mid-career realisation about her deep-rooted need to rediscover and be proud of her femininity helped Vanessa to discover things she never knew about herself, and introduced much-needed support from other women, which had been absent throughout her career. The book provides transparent insight into the world of corporate women, addresses the challenges facing every ambitious person throughout their career journey and tackles our never-ending search for balance. Packed with tips, advice and practical steps based on real life experiences, this autobiographical story is also a practical guide that will fast become a must-read for anyone seeking to not only survive the corporate jungle, but stand some chance of thriving in it!', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D12FAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Heels of Steel');

Martin himself—A Feast of Ice and Fire lovingly replicates a stunning range of cuisines from across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. From the sumptuous delicacies enjoyed in the halls of power at King’s Landing, to the warm and smoky comfort foods of the frozen North, to the rich, exotic fare of the mysterious lands east of Westeros, there’s a flavor for every palate, and a treat for every chef. These easy-to-follow recipes have been refined for modern cooking techniques, but adventurous eaters can also attempt the authentic medieval meals that inspired them. The authors have also suggested substitutions for some of the more fantastical ingredients, so you won’t have to stock your kitchen with camel, live doves, or dragon eggs to create meals fit for a king (or a khaleesi). In all, A Feast of Ice and Fire contains more than 100 recipes, divided by region: • The Wall: Rack of Lamb and Herbs; Pork Pie; Mutton in Onion-Ale Broth; Mulled Wine; Pease Porridge • The North: Beef and Bacon Pie; Honeyed Chicken; Aurochs with Roasted Leeks; Baked Apples • The South: Cream Swans; Trout Wrapped in Bacon; Stewed Rabbit; Sister’s Stew; Blueberry Tarts • King’s Landing: Lemon Cakes; Quails Drowned in Butter; Almond Crusted Trout; Bowls of Brown; Iced Milk with Honey • Dorne: Stuffed Grape Leaves; Duck with Lemons; Chickpea Paste • Across the Narrow Sea: Biscuits and Bacon; Tyroshi Honeyfingers; Wintercakes; Honey-Spiced Locusts There’s even a guide to dining and entertaining in the style of the Seven Kingdoms. Exhaustively researched and reverently detailed, accompanied by passages from all five books in the series and full-color photographs guaranteed to whet your appetite, this is the companion to the blockbuster phenomenon that millions of stomachs have been growling for. And remember, winter is coming—so don’t be afraid to put on a few pounds. Includes a Foreword by George R. R. Martin From the Hardcover edition.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nbpa7hW4hgAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Feast of Ice and Fire: The Official Game of Thrones Companion Cookbook');

In the title poem of this beautiful collection, Cement Shoes, we hear the poet’s brother from his Harley tell her, … “your soul is different,/ your soul is full of books, / and your feet are in cement shoes.” He couldn’t be more right … cement carrying the landscape of Iowa, the land, the creeks, the earth, and the girls growing up among the rows of corn, whose “hair hung down, crazy silks among the rows; / banshees in the corn, …/. Here are lines that resonate long after reading these strong and radiant poems envisioned with an eye as clear as you might imagine an Iowa sky sees in reflection. Here is a poet grounded in her Iowa as in her poems … observant, wry and beautiful lines that weave to water’s edge, from Dry Run Creek, to New Orleans, to New York and back to Iowa … the poet tells us, “I have come so far from Iowa / only to find it in my body. / The blackest dirt on earth and I am every inch and acre of it./ bones planted deep, where no light nor rain can reach. The tall corn grows … and still my hair grows / like prairie.” This wildness pressing the edges of her lines, compels the poet’s voice in this gorgeous body of work. —Susan R.

Providing public goods, securing their financing, maintenance, and improving the efficiency of their delivery, has generated a voluminous literature and series of debates. More recently, these issues have again become a central concern, as new public management approaches have transformed the role of the state in the provision of public goods and the modalities by which the financing of infrastructure and its operation are procured. Yet, despite the proliferation of new modalities of regulating infrastructure little is known about what works and why. Why do certain regulatory regimes fail and others succeed? What regulatory designs and institutional features produce optimal outcomes and how? And why do regulatory forms of governance when transplanted into different institutional contexts produce less than uniform outcomes? This book addresses these questions, exploring the theoretical foundations of regulation as well as a series of case studies drawn from the telecommunications, electricity, and water sectors. It brings together distinguished scholars and expert practitioners to explore the practical problems of regulation, regulatory design, infrastructure operation, and the implications for infrastructure provision.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D43OHEtM43wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Infrastructure Regulation');

This volume is the culmination of an unprecedented effort to document, analyze, and interpret the full extent of the challenge in developing Sub-Saharan Africa s infrastructure sectors. As a result, it represents the most comprehensive reference currently available on infrastructure in the region. The book covers the five main economic infrastructure sectors information and communication technology, irrigation, power, transport, and water and sanitation. ''Africa s Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation'' reflects the collaboration of a wide array of African regional institutions and development partners under the auspices of the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa. It presents the findings of the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD), a project launched following a commitment in 2005 by the international community (after the G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland) to scale up financial support for infrastructure development in Africa. The lack of reliable information in this area made it difficult to evaluate the success of past interventions, prioritize current allocations, and provide benchmarks for measuring future progress, hence the need for the AICD. Africa s infrastructure sectors lag well behind those of the rest of the world, and the gap is widening. Some of the main policy-relevant findings highlighted in the book include the following: infrastructure in the region is exceptionally expensive, with tariffs being many times higher than those found elsewhere. Inadequate and expensive infrastructure is retarding growth by 2 percentage points each year. Solving the problem will cost over US$90 billion per year, which is more than twice what is being spent in Africa today. However, money alone is not the answer. Prudent policies, wise management, and sound maintenance can improve efficiency, thereby stretching the infrastructure dollar. There is the potential to recover an additional US$17 billion a year from within the existing infrastructure resource envelope simply by improving efficiency. For example, improved revenue collection and utility management could generate US$3.3 billion per year. Regional power trade could reduce annual costs by US$2 billion. And deregulating the trucking industry could reduce freight costs by one-half. So, raising more funds without also tackling inefficiencies would be like pouring water into a leaking bucket. Finally, the power sector and fragile states represent particular challenges. Even if every efficiency in every infrastructure sector could be captured, a substantial funding gap of $31 billion a year would remain. Nevertheless, the African people and economies cannot wait any longer. Now is the time to begin the transformation to sustainable development.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lS-qW8R-mhwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Africa''s Infrastructure');

Thus, an analysis of infrastructures'' contributions to growth must look at the impacts of services as actually perceived, not at indirect indicators that measure only aggregate provision of infrastructure capital. The paper notes that macro and industry level research , although having its limitations, suggest a positive and statistically significant relationship between infrastructure and economic output. However the conclusions derived from this research (most of which derives from developed countries) provide little specific guidance for policy. To gain more practical insights about how infrastructure contributes to economic growth and to improved quality of life, and to understand the welfare costs of inadequate or unreliable infrastructure, it is necessary to look at microeconomic evidence. Particularly interesting illustrations of these relationships are to be found in developing countries where there is wide variance in the availability and quality of infrastructure.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOH0ra5QaoMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Contributions of Infrastructure to Economic Development');

This book asserts that the current impediments to economic growth and development need to be tackled through policies and investment strategies that renew efforts to reform state-owned utilities, build on the lessons of private participation in infrastructure projects, retarget electrification strategies, expand regional power trade, and mobilize new funding resources. Further development of regional power trade would allow Africa to harness larger-scale and more cost-effective energy sources, reducing energy system costs by US$2 billion and carbon dioxide emissions by 70 million tons annually. But reaping the promise of regional trade depends on a handful of major exporting countries raising the large volumes of finance needed to develop generation capacity for export; it also requires a large number of importing countries to muster the requisite political will. With increased utility efficiency and regional power trade in play, power costs would fall and full cost recovery tariffs could become affordable in much of Africa. This will make utilities more creditworthy and help sustain the flow of external finance to the sector, which is essential to close the huge financing gap.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPasSxcQ858C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Africa''s Power Infrastructure');

The Patriot Army was shaped and strengthened by the desperate circumstances of the Valley Forge winter. This is where Curzon the boy becomes Curzon the young man. In addition to the hardships of soldiering, he lives with the fear of discovery, for he is an escaped slave passing for free. And then there is Isabel, who is also at Valley Forge—against her will.

Traditionally, the goal of psychology has been to relieve human suffering, but the goal of the Positive Psychology movement, which Dr. Seligman has led for fifteen years, is different—it’s about actually raising the bar for the human condition. Flourish builds on Dr. Seligman’s game-changing work on optimism, motivation, and character to show how to get the most out of life, unveiling an electrifying new theory of what makes a good life—for individuals, for communities, and for nations. In a fascinating evolution of thought and practice, Flourish refines what Positive Psychology is all about. While certainly a part of well-being, happiness alone doesn’t give life meaning. Seligman now asks, What is it that enables you to cultivate your talents, to build deep, lasting relationships with others, to feel pleasure, and to contribute meaningfully to the world? In a word, what is it that allows you to flourish? “Well-being” takes the stage front and center, and Happiness (or Positive Emotion) becomes one of the five pillars of Positive Psychology, along with Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment—or PERMA, the permanent building blocks for a life of profound fulfillment. Thought-provoking in its implications for education, economics, therapy, medicine, and public policy—the very fabric of society—Flourish tells inspiring stories of Positive Psychology in action, including how the entire U.S. Army is now trained in emotional resilience; how innovative schools can educate for fulfillment in life and not just for workplace success; and how corporations can improve performance at the same time as they raise employee well-being. With interactive exercises to help readers explore their own attitudes and aims, Flourish is a watershed in the understanding of happiness as well as a tool for getting the most out of life. On the cutting edge of a science that has changed millions of lives, Dr. Seligman now creates the ultimate extension and capstone of his bestselling classics, Authentic Happiness and Learned Optimism.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ng7RJW-udoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Flourish');

With its gentle approach to working with the spine, the skull and its cranial sutures, diaphragms, and fascia, CST has proven equally useful for physical therapists, massage therapists, naturopaths, chiropractors, and osteopaths. One reason for its success has been its underlying theory, as explained by CST pioneer John Upledger. According to Upledger, bodily tissues and cells have individual memories, and traumatic memories can be stored in these cells and tissues.Cell Talk, written for the layperson, explores this concept in depth and shows practitioners how to use it in healing their patients. The book offers simple strategies for treating disease and dysfunction by communicating with these cells to uncover the memories and then follow the healing path they suggest. Upledger blends the scientific aspects of cell biology with insights into the nature of inner consciousness, in the process uncovering the deep links between physiology, energy, health, and healing.

While most of these organizations have no direct connection to human rights issues, their participation in broader IGO networks has important implications for the human rights practices of their member states. Featuring a rigorous empirical analysis, Transmitting Rights shows that countries tend to adopt similar human rights practices to those of their IGO partners, whether for better or worse. Greenhill argues that IGOs constitute a tightly-woven fabric of ties between states and that this network provides an important channel through which states can influence the behavior of others. Indeed, his analysis suggests that a policy of isolating "rogue" states is probably self-defeating given that this will reduce their exposure to some of the more positive IGO-based influences on their human rights. Greenhill''s analysis of the role of IGOs in rights diffusion will not only increase our understanding of the international politics of human rights; it will also reshape how we think about the role of international institutions in world politics.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wXYRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Transmitting Rights');

Although there are no known examples of arch dams which have been seriously damaged by earthquakes, the need for more realistic seismic analyses is now well recognized, not only for new dams but especially in the context of the safety evaluation of existing dams. Fortunately, with the finite element method, engineers have a powerful tool for modeling the complex geometry and the nonlinear material behavior of a dam. However, there is still a major complication in the analysis procedure, namely the interaction of the dam with the reservoir and with the foundation during an earthquake. Interaction is a wave propagation problem involving transmitting boundaries. The State of the Art in engineering practice is to neglect wave propagation by modeling the water as incompressible and the foundation as massless. More advanced analysis methods using compressible water and foundation with mass have been available for some time. However, these methods are restricted to linear models, because they work in the frequency domain. On the other hand, there are also advanced nonlinear models for dams, but they can only be used in the time domain, usually with simple transmitting boundaries. In this report, which is based on an a doctoral thesis, rigorous transmitting boundaries in the time domain are developed which permit combining compressible water with n- linear dam behavior. The new numerical model is based on a systems-theory approach.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OFn2BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Rational Transmitting Boundaries for Time-Domain Analysis of Dam-Reservoir Interaction');

Kennedy Library and with the never-before-published safari journal of Hemingway’s second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer. When it was first published in 1935, The New York Times called Green Hills of Africa, “The best-written story of big-game hunting anywhere,” Hemingway’s evocative account of his safari through East Africa with his wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, captures his fascination with big-game hunting. In examining the grace of the chase and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. Green Hills of Africa is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape and the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man. This new Hemingway Library Edition offers a fresh perspective on Hemingway’s classic travelogue, with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, who spent many years as a professional hunter in East Africa; a new introduction by Seán Hemingway, grandson of the author; and, published for the first time in its entirety, the African journal of Hemingway’s wife, Pauline, which offers an intimate glimpse into thoughts and experiences that shaped her husband’s craft.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hE8jBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Green Hills of Africa');

Many migrations were made in response to policy decisions made in Hanoi, first by the French colonial authorities and later by Vietnam''s independent socialist states.

Placing people''s experiences in the context of government policy and national history, this book explores their anticipations, difficulties, achievements and disappointments, high-lighting the geopolitical importance of the highlands.

Although unique in its power to transform both the site in which a work is constructed and the viewer''s experience of being in a place, installation art has not received the critical attention accorded other art forms. In Space, Site, Intervention, some of today''s most prominent art critics, curators, and artists view installation art as a diverse, multifaceted, and international art form that challenges institutional assumptions and narrow conceptual frameworks. The contributors discuss installation in relation to the genealogy of modern art, community and corporate space, multimedia cyberspace, public and private ritual, the gallery and the museum, public and private patronage, and political action. This ambitious volume focuses on issues of class, sexuality, cultural identity rase, and gender, and highlights a wide range of artists whose work is often marginalized by mainstream art history and criticism. Together, the essays in Space, Site, Intervention investigate how installation resonates within modern culture and society, as well as its ongoing influence on contemporary visual culture.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3CwSWamWVwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Space, Site, Intervention');

In that time, the data warehouse industry has reached full maturity and acceptance, hardware and software have made staggering advances, and the techniques promoted in the premiere edition of this book have been adopted by nearly all data warehouse vendors and practitioners. In addition, the term "business intelligence" emerged to reflect the mission of the data warehouse: wrangling the data out of source systems, cleaning it, and delivering it to add value to the business. Ralph Kimball and his colleagues have refined the original set of Lifecycle methods and techniques based on their consulting and training experience. The authors understand first-hand that a data warehousing/business intelligence (DW/BI) system needs to change as fast as its surrounding organization evolves. To that end, they walk you through the detailed steps of designing, developing, and deploying a DW/BI system.

In the modern era, racial distinctiveness has been assessed primarily in terms of a person''s physical appearance. But it was not always so. As Denise McCoskey shows, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not use skin colour as the basis for categorising ethnic disparity. The colour of one''s skin lies at the foundation of racial variability today because it was used during the heyday of European exploration and colonialism to construct a hierarchy of civilizations and then justify slavery and other forms of economic exploitation. Assumptions about race thus have to take into account factors other than mere physiognomy. This is particularly true in relation to the classical world. In fifth century Athens, racial theory during the Persian Wars produced the categories ''Greek'' and ''Barbarian'', and set them in brutal opposition to one another: a process that could be as intense and destructive as ''black and ''white'' in our own age. Ideas about race in antiquity were therefore completely distinct but as closely bound to political and historical contexts as those that came later. This provocative book boldly explores the complex matrices of race - and the differing interpretations of ancient and modern - across epic, tragedy and the novel. Ranging from Theocritus to Toni Morrison, and from Tacitus and Pliny to Bernal''s seminal study Black Athena, this is a powerful and original new assessment.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dJNaON2p2OMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Race');

From an international point of view, Belgium has been a trendsetter in many ways. It was the first country on the European continent to experience a quick process of industrialisation, with the development of the first liberal state following closely behind. More than elsewhere, liberalism reigned supreme in the 19th century, and as a result the social question was raised with great vehemence. The World Wars put Belgium in the middle of the fighting twice over; especially after 1945, the country played a prominent international role, first in the foundation of the Atlantic alliance and the European construction, and later in the decolonisation of the Congo. In the meantime, Belgium has developed into one of the countries experiencing the full force of globalisation, and, thanks to Brussels, into one of the preeminent international political centres. Belgium is also a model of pacification democracy. Throughout many conflicts during the 19th and 20th centuries, an enduring compromise grew between Catholics and freethinkers, making Belgium one of the most pluralistic countries in Europe today. The fierce conflict between workers and employers, in its turn, led to a well-functioning model of a consultation and welfare state. Two cultures live together in Belgium. Up until the second half of the past century, the Flemish majority was at an economic, political and cultural disadvantage; during the process of catching up, coinciding with the demise of the Walloon economy, a complex federal model developed, in which cosmopolitan Brussels takes a very special position. This book aims to offer a historical perspective in interpreting the current tensions in Belgian politics based on scientific literature. Political History of Belgium is without doubt the outstanding authoritative reference work about the political history of a country at the centre of the development of Europe. As such, it offers essential background information for politicians, policy makers, civil servants, journalists, researchers, students and anyone with an interest in Belgium and Europe.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n4Em8G76kbkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Political History of Belgium');

In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship. Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security. Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi''s website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully ("Your site summarizes everything I want with my life--to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings," Dan Esparza) and effusively ("Dude, you rock. I love this site!" Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: "Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in" (San Francisco Chronicle). His writing is smart, his voice is full of attitude, and his ideas are uncommonly sound and refreshingly hype-free.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YtE6JJ78XLcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'I Will Teach You To Be Rich');

Because if you know how cars are sold, you’ll know how to buy them!...and I left no stone unturned. There is no other single book in the world with all the “inside” information on the details of buying and selling cars.

If it’s not in here, it’s not worth knowing. No longer does the experience of buying a car have to be only moderately better than going to the dentist.

Well, congratulations because you have found the right book. Not even the table of contents can show all the lessons contained within this book meant to help consumers fight all types of financial problems just as Danny Singh fights for his mother including avoiding a foreclosure, reclaiming a repossessed car, fixing credit, avoiding deceptive loans as well as checking accounts filled with fees, and getting denied credit applications approved. In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.

However, few books are available to train professionals and students who are not professional programmers to develop these information systems. Developing Windows-Based and Web-Enabled Information Systems fills this gap, providing a self-contained, easy-to-understand, and well-illustrated text that explores current concepts, methods, and software tools for developing Windows-based and web-enabled information systems. Written in an easily accessible style, the book details current concepts, methods, and software tools for Windows-based and web-enabled information systems that store and use data. It is self-contained with easy-to-understand small examples to walk through concepts and implementation details along with large-scale case studies. The book describes data modeling methods including entity–relationship modeling, relational modeling and normalization, and object-oriented data modeling, to develop data models of a database. The author covers how to use software tools in the Microsoft application development environment, including Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL, Visual Studio, Visual Basic, VBA, HTML, and XML, to implement databases and develop Windows-based and web-enabled applications with the database, graphical user interface, and program components. The book takes you through the entire process of developing a computer and network application for an information system, highlighting concepts and operation details. In each chapter, small data examples are used to manually walk through concepts and operational details. These features and more give you the conceptual understanding and practical skill required, even if you don’t have a computer science background, to develop Windows-based or web-enabled applications for your specialized information system.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5PSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Developing Windows-Based and Web-Enabled Information Systems');

Organizations need an effective method of accessing, visualizing, and reducing spatial information accessibility time. This is important for government organizations and GIS community. The WebGIS methodology was used as a way of reducing the tediousness of spatial information accessibility. This research investigated users'' difficulties in accessing spatial information within various GIS environments as well as the inherent difficulties of the spatial information environment. After the sample population group completed the survey, descriptive statistics were used to analyze the study data. The results showed that spatial information retrieving skills and uneasiness changed at a 5% level of significance as a result of the treatment. This finding is particularly important for Geographic Information Officers (GIO), GIS users, and geo-decision makers faced with increasingly larger spatial information; the GPS data logger treatment can be used as an alternative to traditional, mind-numbing, GIS accessibility methods. Users constrained by distance and technology may also realize a direct benefit. The study''s sample population indicated that they would use the WebGIS treatment again. Increased GIS user accessibility time, user flexibility, and contributions to the GIS field combined, have impacted positive social change. The WebGIS treatment would have positive social impact and beneficial to people in the GIS communities by providing effective spatial information that can be accessed with relative ease and reduce production costs significantly with the implementation of WebGIS.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XIzNb-IbIcsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Effects of Web-enabled GIS Relational Database Management System in an Organization');

For businesses integrating open-source software into their enterprise, Open Sources reveals the mysteries of how open development builds better software, and how businesses can leverage freely available software for a competitive business advantage.The contributors here have been the leaders in the open-source arena: Brian Behlendorf (Apache) Kirk McKusick (Berkeley Unix) Tim O''Reilly (Publisher, O''Reilly & Associates) Bruce Perens (Debian Project, Open Source Initiative) Tom Paquin and Jim Hamerly (mozilla.org, Netscape) Eric Raymond (Open Source Initiative) Richard Stallman (GNU, Free Software Foundation, Emacs) Michael Tiemann (Cygnus Solutions) Linus Torvalds (Linux) Paul Vixie (Bind) Larry Wall (Perl) This book explains why the majority of the Internet''s servers use open- source technologies for everything from the operating system to Web serving and email. Key technology products developed with open-source software have overtaken and surpassed the commercial efforts of billion dollar companies like Microsoft and IBM to dominate software markets. Learn the inside story of what led Netscape to decide to release its source code using the open-source mode. Learn how Cygnus Solutions builds the world''s best compilers by sharing the source code. Learn why venture capitalists are eagerly watching Red Hat Software, a company that gives its key product -- Linux -- away.For the first time in print, this book presents the story of the open- source phenomenon told by the people who created this movement.Open Sources will bring you into the world of free software and show you the revolution.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bjMsCKvV9I4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Open Sources');

Leaving source code open has generated some of the most sophisticated developments in computer technology, including, most notably, Linux and Apache, which pose a significant challenge to Microsoft in the marketplace. As Steven Weber discusses, open source''s success in a highly competitive industry has subverted many assumptions about how businesses are run, and how intellectual products are created and protected. Traditionally, intellectual property law has allowed companies to control knowledge and has guarded the rights of the innovator, at the expense of industry-wide cooperation. In turn, engineers of new software code are richly rewarded; but, as Weber shows, in spite of the conventional wisdom that innovation is driven by the promise of individual and corporate wealth, ensuring the free distribution of code among computer programmers can empower a more effective process for building intellectual products. In the case of Open Source, independent programmers--sometimes hundreds or thousands of them--make unpaid contributions to software that develops organically, through trial and error. Weber argues that the success of open source is not a freakish exception to economic principles. The open source community is guided by standards, rules, decisionmaking procedures, and sanctioning mechanisms. Weber explains the political and economic dynamics of this mysterious but important market development. Table of Contents: Preface 1. Property and the Problem of Software 2.

Notes Index Reviews of this book: In the world of open-source software, true believers can be a fervent bunch. Linux, for example, may act as a credo as well as an operating system. But there is much substance beyond zealotry, says Steven Weber, the author of The Success of Open Source...An open-source operating system offers its source code up to be played with, extended, debugged, and otherwise tweaked in an orgy of user collaboration. The author traces the roots of that ethos and process in the early years of computers...He also analyzes the interface between open source and the worlds of business and law, as well as wider issues in the clash between hierarchical structures and networks, a subject with relevance beyond the software industry to the war on terrorism. --Nina C. Ayoub, Chronicle of Higher Education Reviews of this book: A valuable new account of the [open-source software] movement. --Edward Rothstein, New York Times We can blindly continue to develop, reward, protect, and organize around knowledge assets on the comfortable assumption that their traditional property rights remain inviolate. Or we can listen to Steven Weber and begin to make our peace with the uncomfortable fact that the very foundations of our familiar "knowledge as property" world have irrevocably shifted. --Alan Kantrow, Chief Knowledge Officer, Monitor Group Ever since the invention of agriculture, human beings have had only three social-engineering tools for organizing any large-scale division of labor: markets (and the carrots of material benefits they offer), hierarchies (and the sticks of punishment they impose), and charisma (and the promises of rapture they offer). Now there is the possibility of a fourth mode of effective social organization--one that we perhaps see in embryo in the creation and maintenance of open-source software. My Berkeley colleague Steven Weber''s book is a brilliant exploration of this fascinating topic. --J. Bradford DeLong, Department of Economics, University of California at Berkeley Steven Weber has produced a significant, insightful book that is both smart and important. The most impressive achievement of this volume is that Weber has spent the time to learn and think about the technological, sociological, business, and legal perspectives related to open source. The Success of Open Source is timely and more thought provoking than almost anything I''ve come across in the past several years. It deserves careful reading by a wide audience. --Jonathan Aronson, Annenberg School for Communication, University of Southern California', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=78SLSiWqy14C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Success of Open Source');

Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software. The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail. To help you beat the odds, O''Reilly has put together Producing Open Source Software, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal. Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level. The book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts. Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis. Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives. He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project. While managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you''ve never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun. Producing Open Source Software takes this into account, too, as it speaks of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of free software developers.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0vbr7xvvzjgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Producing Open Source Software');

Sven Beckert''s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world''s most significant manufacturing industry combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in 1780, these men created a potent innovation (Beckert calls it war capitalism, capitalism based on unrestrained actions of private individuals; the domination of masters over slaves, of colonial capitalists over indigenous inhabitants), and crucially affected the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia. We see how this thing called war capitalism shaped the rise of cotton, and then was used as a lever to transform the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways, Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the modern world. The result is a book as unsettling and disturbing as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist"--Résumé de l''éditeur.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kIPZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Empire of Cotton');

Jennifer Thompson was raped at knifepoint by a man who broke into her apartment while she slept. She was able to escape, and eventually positively identified Ronald Cotton as her attacker. Ronald insisted that she was mistaken-- but Jennifer''s positive identification was the compelling evidence that put him behind bars. After eleven years, Ronald was allowed to take a DNA test that proved his innocence. He was released, after serving more than a decade in prison for a crime he never committed. Two years later, Jennifer and Ronald met face to face-- and forged an unlikely friendship that changed both of their lives. With Picking Cotton, Jennifer and Ronald tell in their own words the harrowing details of their tragedy, and challenge our ideas of memory and judgment while demonstrating the profound nature of human grace and the healing power of forgiveness.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Bp3JMdp_MgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Picking Cotton');

Patients now legally can write advance directives to govern their treatment decisions at a time of future incapacity, yet in clinical practice their wishes often are ignored. Examining the tension between incompetent patients'' prior wishes and their current best interests as well as other challenges to advance directives, Robert S. Olick offers a comprehensive argument for favoring advance instructions during the dying process. He clarifies widespread confusion about the moral and legal weight of advance directives, and he prescribes changes in law, policy, and practice that would not only ensure that directives count in the care of the dying but also would define narrow instances when directives should not be followed. Olick also presents and develops an original theory of prospective autonomy that recasts and strengthens patient and family control. While focusing largely on philosophical issues the book devotes substantial attention to legal and policy questions and includes case studies throughout. An important resource for medical ethicists, lawyers, physicians, nurses, health care professionals, and patients'' rights advocates, it champions the practical, ethical, and humane duty of taking advance directives seriously where it matters most-at the bedside of dying patients.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AcIpW6sysS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Taking Advance Directives Seriously');

It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what''s possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded Mastering Oracle SQL has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle''s implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don''t explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL.

Ultimately this policy failed, leaving behind inefficient state economic enterprises and widespread poverty. Political unrest in 1988 led a newly installed military government to liberalize the economy, opening it to foreign investment and private participation in trade. This move towards a market economy was in line with world-wide trends, but political instability forced the country to follow a course different from neighboring countries. By analyzing economic policies and performance across the economic spectrum, this book presents an overall picture of economic development in Myanmar between 1988 and the early 2000s. The authors synthesize both macro and micro level data to overcome some of the limitations of unreliable national statistics, and show how the government attempted to deal with two key issues it faced. The first was how to reform the inefficient socialistic economic system in conformity with a market economy, and the second was how to develop the agricultural and underdeveloped economy to alleviate mass poverty.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EvSEIbyr2-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Economic Transition in Myanmar After 1988');

As farmers began to operate in a context with greatly reduced government control, there was an explosion in the production of green gram, which became extremely popular as an export crop. However, market liberalization in the industry surrounding this new export-oriented crop gave rise to growing economic disparities, largely determined by access to land, capital and credit. Ikuko Okamoto explores these issues through a detailed case study of Thongwa Township, a place east of Yangon (Rangoon) in the major green gram producing region in the country. She shows that farmers responded quickly to policy changes and made maximum use of new opportunities, even in a country where socialist policies had previously limited such opportunities. She also traces the consequences for different social groups in rural Myanmar, and shows that traders benefited the most from the new arrangements, and landless laborers the least. Her research offers important insights into the transition from a socialist to a market-based economy, and local-level responses to market incentives. It also shows that the success or failure of new crops in a peasant economy largely depends on whether the crop is compatible with the initial resource endowment.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NIDwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Economic Disparity in Rural Myanmar');

Burma in particular has served as a "back door" to Yunnan, providing a sanctuary for political refugees and economic opportunities for trade explorers. Since the Chinese Communist takeover in 1949 and subsequent political upheavals in China, an unprecedented number of Yunnanese refugees have fled to Burma. Through a personal narrative approach, Beyond Borders is the first ethnography to focus on the migration history and transnational trading experiences of contemporary Yunnanese Chinese migrants (composed of both Yunnanese Han and Muslims) who reside in Burma and those who have moved from Burma and resettled in Thailand, Taiwan, and China. Since the 1960s, Yunnanese Chinese migrants of Burma have dominated the transnational trade in opium, jade, and daily consumption goods. Wen-Chin Chang writes with deep knowledge of this trade''s organization from the 1960s of mule-driven caravans to the use of modern transportation, and she reconstructs trading routes while examining embedded sociocultural meanings. These Yunnanese migrants’ mobility attests to the prevalence of travel not only by the privileged but also by different kinds of people. Their narratives disclose individual life processes as well as networks of connections, modes of transportation, and differences between the experiences of men and women.

Addressing children''s classics as well as the Disney affiliates'' more recent attempts to capture adult audiences, the contributors respond to the Disney film legacy from feminist, marxist, poststructuralist, and cultural studies perspectives. The volume contemplates Disney''s duality as an American icon and as an industry of cultural production, created in and through fifty years of filmmaking. The contributors treat a range of topics at issue in contemporary cultural studies: the performance of gender, race, and class; the engendered images of science, nature, technology, family, and business. The compilation of voices in From Mouse to Mermaid creates a persuasive cultural critique of Disney''s ideology.

Theory is woven into thousands of proven techniques, tips, tactics, tools and strategies spread over nearly 600 pages. Explanations, examples and anecdotes are in a language that should appeal to experienced practitioners, college students and organization volunteers who assist with public relations and publicity. "The PR Practitioner''s Playbook" - an anatomy of the public relations profession - relies on my experience as a reporter, editor, public relations counselor, and strategic advisor and evaluator. It demonstrates that successful writers practice their craft with poise and eloquence. It is an extension of the author''s classroom, which many students call, "Litwin''s laboratory for practical knowledge." As former KYW Newsradio colleague Kim Glovas observed," Larry''s voice is the voice of this book." Among those considered mentors - and contributors to this book - are Nick George, former managing editor at ABC Radio News, ABC sportscaster Howard Cosell, KYW Newsradio anchor Bill Bransome, print journalist extraordinaire Everett S. Landers and legendary broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. They spent countless hours helping the author hone his skills and encouraging me to be an open, honest, thorough and valid (relevant) communicator. They stressed tangible tools, and such attributes as knowledge, loyalty, judgment, trust, credibility, ethics and integrity. "The Public Relations Practitioner''s Playbook" serves as a basic or supplemental text in introduction to public relations and graduate overview courses. It offers a refreshing, down-to-earth approach to which many students are just not accustomed. Strategic advisors refer to it as a "potpourri of proven public relations techniques."

The introductory part addresses the early history of pyrethrum, its recognition as a modern insecticide, and its worldwide production. The chemistry and biochemistry parts discuss the composition, isolation, structure, synthesis, biosynthesis, metabolism, and action on enzyme systems of natural pyrethrins extracted from pyrethrum flower. The book also examines the toxicology of pyrethrum and its constituents to mammals, fish, and wildlife, as well as tests for possible teratogenic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and allergenic activities.

Pelton soon embarked on a globe-spanning odyssey to penetrate and understand this shadowy world, ultimately delivering stunning insights into the way private soldiers are used. Enter a blood-soaked world of South African mercenaries and tribal fighters backed by ruthless financiers. Drop into Baghdad’s Green Zone, strap on body armor, and take a daily high-speed ride with a doomed crew of security contractors who dodge car bombs and snipers just to get their charges to the airport. Share a drink in a chic hotel bar with wealthy owners of private armies who debate the best way to stay alive in war zones. Licensed to Kill spans four continents and three years, taking us inside the CIA’s dirty wars; the brutal contractor murders in Fallujah and the Alamo-like sieges in Najaf and Al Kut; the Deep South contractor training camps where ex–Special Operations soldiers and even small town cops learn the ropes; the contractor conventions where macho attendees swap bullet-punctuated tales and discuss upcoming gigs; and the grim Central African prison where contractors turned failed mercenaries pay a steep price. The United States has encouraged the use of the private sector in all facets of the War on Terror, placing contractors outside the bounds of functional legal constraints. With the shocking clarity that can come only from firsthand observation, Licensed to Kill painstakingly deconstructs the most controversial events and introduces the pivotal players. Most disturbingly, it shows that there are indeed thousands of contractors—with hundreds more being produced every month—who’ve been given a license to kill, their services available to the highest bidder.

The first documents the development of a de facto relationship between law and psychiatry that simultaneously silences and blames victims of sexual violence, and advances a critique of law as narrative. The second presents a detailed, critical, feminist reading of six trials that are presented as textual case studies. These show the legal mechanisms through which victim/survivor’s accounts of abuse are transmuted into forms that facilitate the legal and theoretical acquittal of the alleged abuser and replicates - at symbolic and structural levels - those power relations inherent in the original abuse. The final step in the argument analyzes and synthesizes the structural and thematic patterns in the case studies to show how trials enact a narrative template that maintain a patriarchal status quo around intrafamilial child sexual abuse.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4MCo2C55cC4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Court Licensed Abuse');

The typical objective of placement is to minimize half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL). To address the timing and layout closure problems brought forth by the aggressive scaling of semiconductor technologies, there is a growing trend in dealing with routing resource constraints and performing physical synthesis techniques in the placement step. In this thesis, we develop techniques at various stages of placement to minimize wirelength and improve routability. In the global placement stage, we consider analytical placement approaches to minimize HPWL. We smooth the HPWL function by recursive extension of two-variable max functions. In the detailed placement stage, we propose a congestion-driven white space allocation approach and an effective local minimization technique to achieve better routability and routed wirelength. We also extend our white space allocation approach as an incremental placement technique to accommodate incremental changes in a placement due to physical synthesis techniques, including gate sizing and buffer insertion.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AViD-JCWC2AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Placement of VLSI Circuits');

In recent years this type of work has been labeled as Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) and is increasingly implemented to promote evidence-based policy choices and foster debate on policy reform options. While information is available on the general approach, techniques, and tools for distributional analysis, each sector displays a series of specific characteristics. These have implications for the analysis of distributional impacts, including the types of impacts and transmission channels that warrant particular attention, the tools and techniques most appropriate, the data source typically utilized, and the range of political economy factors most likely to affect the reform process.

The book shows how the parts of a curriculum fit together and how to identify assumptions underlying curricula.

In this book, noted Bach expert Eric Chafe combines theological, historical, analytical, and interpretive approaches to the cantatas to offer readers and listeners alike the richest possible experience of these works. A respected theorist of seventeenth-century music, Chafe is sensitive to the composer''s intentions and to the enduring and universal qualities of the music itself. Concentrating on a small number of representative cantatas, mostly from the Leipzig cycles of 1723-24 and 1724-25, and in particular on Cantata 77, Chafe shows how Bach strove to mirror both the dogma and the mystery of religious experience in musical allegory. Analyzing Bach Cantatas offers valuable information on the theological relevance of the structure of the liturgical year for the design and content of these works, as well as a survey of the theories of modality that inform Bach''s compositional style. Chafe demonstrates that, while Bach certainly employed "pictorialism" and word-painting in his compositions, his method of writing music was a more complex amalgam of theological concepts and music theory. Regarding the cantatas as musical allegories that reflect the fundamental tenets of Lutheran theology as established during Bach''s lifetime, Chafe synthesizes a number of key musical and theological ideas to illuminate the essential character of these great works. This unique and insightful book offers an essential methodology for understanding one of the central bodies of work in the Western musical canon. It will prove indispensable for all students and scholars of Bach''s work, musicology, and theological studies.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wVXP165e-uEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Analyzing Bach Cantatas');

This was a means of describing their wealth and sophistication, their willingness to trade with the West, and their presumed capacity to become Christianized. But by the end of the seventeenth century the category of whiteness was reserved for Europeans only. When and how did Asians become "yellow" in the Western imagination? Looking at the history of racial thinking, Becoming Yellow explores the notion of yellowness and shows that this label originated not in early travel texts or objective descriptions, but in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scientific discourses on race. From the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb, which depicted people of varying skin tones including yellow, to the phrase "yellow peril" at the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe and America, Michael Keevak follows the development of perceptions about race and human difference. He indicates that the conceptual relationship between East Asians and yellow skin did not begin in Chinese culture or Western readings of East Asian cultural symbols, but in anthropological and medical records that described variations in skin color. Eighteenth-century taxonomers such as Carl Linnaeus, as well as Victorian scientists and early anthropologists, assigned colors to all racial groups, and once East Asians were lumped with members of the Mongolian race, they began to be considered yellow. Demonstrating how a racial distinction took root in Europe and traveled internationally, Becoming Yellow weaves together multiple narratives to tell the complex history of a problematic term.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZmHNk38OgDEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Becoming Yellow');

Another chapter covers the notion that radio listeners of today are now consumers and users. Listeners are now familiar with functioning within a digital environment, accessing the information, and they may be considered co-producers.

Driven by aerospace applications the focus of the book is primarily on continuous-dynamical systems. The text is a three-part treatment, beginning with robust and optimal linear control methods and moving on to a self-contained presentation of the design and analysis of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. Recent extensions and modifications to MRAC design are included, as are guidelines for combining robust optimal and MRAC controllers. Features of the text include: · case studies that demonstrate the benefits of robust and adaptive control for piloted, autonomous and experimental aerial platforms; · detailed background material for each chapter to motivate theoretical developments; · realistic examples and simulation data illustrating key features of the methods described; and · problem solutions for instructors and MATLAB® code provided electronically. The theoretical content and practical applications reported address real-life aerospace problems, being based on numerous transitions of control-theoretic results into operational systems and airborne vehicles that are drawn from the authors’ extensive professional experience with The Boeing Company. The systems covered are challenging, often open-loop unstable, with uncertainties in their dynamics, and thus requiring both persistently reliable control and the ability to track commands either from a pilot or a guidance computer. Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of root locus, Bode diagrams, and Nyquist plots, as well as linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and the use of state-space methods in analysis and modeling of dynamical systems.

Robustness in speech recognition refers to the need to maintain high speech recognition accuracy even when the quality of the input speech is degraded, or when the acoustical, articulate, or phonetic characteristics of speech in the training and testing environments differ. Obstacles to robust recognition include acoustical degradations produced by additive noise, the effects of linear filtering, nonlinearities in transduction or transmission, as well as impulsive interfering sources, and diminished accuracy caused by changes in articulation produced by the presence of high-intensity noise sources. Although progress over the past decade has been impressive, there are significant obstacles to overcome before speech recognition systems can reach their full potential. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must be robust to all levels, so that they can handle background or channel noise, the occurrence on unfamiliar words, new accents, new users, or unanticipated inputs. They must exhibit more ''intelligence'' and integrate speech with other modalities, deriving the user''s intent by combining speech with facial expressions, eye movements, gestures, and other input features, and communicating back to the user through multimedia responses. Therefore, as speech recognition technology is transferred from the laboratory to the marketplace, robustness in recognition becomes increasingly significant.

For such environments, we suggest the use of the robustness ap proach to decision making, which assumes inadequate knowledge of the decision maker about the random state of nature and develops a decision that hedges against the worst contingency that may arise. The main motivating factors for a decision maker to use the robustness approach are: • It does not ignore uncertainty and takes a proactive step in response to the fact that forecasted values of uncertain parameters will not occur in most environments; • It applies to decisions of unique, non-repetitive nature, which are common in many fast and dynamically changing environments; • It accounts for the risk averse nature of decision makers; and • It recognizes that even though decision environments are fraught with data uncertainties, decisions are evaluated ex post with the realized data. For all of the above reasons, robust decisions are dear to the heart of opera tional decision makers.

It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems.

STORM organizes individual nodes with similar mobility patterns and speeds into teams, and builds a hierarchy-based multicast mesh structure among elected team nodes. A Unicast Acknowledgement Scheme (UAS) is developed to build the routing structure in a memory saving manner. To improve the reliability of STORM, a modified version of Reliable Adaptive Congestion controlled multicasT (ReACT) is used as a reliable transport protocol. The performance results of the simulation indicate that STORM is scalable as the number of multicast groups, multicast sources, and network load increase. Furthermore, the adoption of ReACT as a transport protocol improves the performance of STORM in conditions of increasing mobility speeds and heavy network traffic load.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2eQ2Ahqxq5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'Scalable Team Oriented Multicast Routing Protocol for Tactical Mobile Ad Hoc Networks');

The project management approach applied in the present book is a holistic management concept. In addition to project planning and control, it also covers the topics of teamwork, communication, and the organizational integration of projects into companies.This book provides a guideline for performing individual projects, for professionally selecting projects that are vital for company success (project portfolio, program), for improving project management quality, and for consequently focusing company work on the current environmental requirements (project-oriented company). Additionally, numerous practical examples and case-studies of different project types illustrate the implementation of the presented methods.Further relevant aspects of today’s project management approaches, such as projects as business cases, procurement and contract design, virtual teamwork, project management career paths, agile project management, or Stage-Gate approaches are integrated into the actual edition.

Silver''s coverage is polymathic, ranging from poker and earthquakes to climate change and terrorism." —New York Review of Books Nate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair’s breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger—all by the time he was thirty. He solidified his standing as the nation''s foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com. Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science. Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise. With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.

With disengagement and turnover on the rise, many managers are scratching their heads wondering what to do. It''s not that we dont dream of being great managers, it''s just that we havent found a practical and efficient way to do it. Until now . . . The fictional company in this remarkable book is grappling with real problems of high turnover and low morale -- so the managers begin to investigate what really drives the employees. What they discover is that the key to motivation isnt necessarily the promise of a bigger paycheck or title, but rather the fulfillment of crucial personal dreams. They also learned that people at every level need to be offered specific kinds of help and encouragement -- or our dreams will forever remain just dreams as we grow dissatisfied with our lives and jobs. Beginning with his important thought that a company can only become the-best-version-of-itself to the extent that its employees are becoming better-versions-of-themselves, Matthew Kelly explores the connection between the dreams we are chasing personally and the way we all engage at work. Tackling head-on the growing problem of employee disengagement, Kelly explores the dynamic collaboration that is unleashed when people work together to achieve company objectives and personal dreams.

However, the processes involved in addressing these areas have become more complex. The proliferation of regulatory mandates, worker compensation issues, increased employee litigation, and violence in the workplace have redefined the role of the facility manager beyond "gatekeeper" to that of full-scale operations manager. Today''s corporations, organizations, and business partnerships invest heavily in their physical plants. It naturally follows that they expect to maximize the return on their investment. Facility managers are seen as the catalysts for ensuring that optimal return. The Facility Manager''s Handbook address all of these issues, and provides a multitude of tested ideas, procedures and examples for successfully and cost-effectively managing facility operations. Written in a plain-language, reader-friendly style, it provides a panoramic view of the process by isolating the key areas the facility manager must address, including real estate, space and change management, indoor air quality, emergency preparedness and response planning, communications systems, regulatory mandates and more. A wealth of illustrations, tables and graphs are included to facilitate a clear understanding.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yseZghBJ0e0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Facility Manager''s Handbook');

VSP combines borehole studies in the seismic frequency band, well velocity surveys, proximity or aplanatic surveys, all of which previously existed as separate methods. The high effectiveness ofVSP, its great practical value, the express nature and clarity of the results obtained have all contributed towards a very rapid acceptance of the method. In the USSR VSP has been used in an overwhelming majority of areas and is being used increasingly in many foreign countries as well. This has been greatly facilitated by the translation into English and the publication in the U. S. A. by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists of the book Vertical Seismic Profiling (Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1974). As the method has become more familiar, it has attracted growing interest outside the USSR This has been substantiated by the special seminar on VSP (Oklahoma, 1979) which was organized for 22 U.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health. They also help make sense of how poverty and oppression—such as racism, homophobia, and classism—affect life opportunity, self-worth, and even influence metabolism. Body insecurity is rampant, and it doesn’t have to be.

The workbook, a Shingo Research Prize recipient in 1999, is filled with actual maps, as well as engaging diagrams and illustrations.The value-stream map is a paper-and-pencil representation of every process in the material and information flow, along with key data. It differs significantly from tools such as process mapping or layout diagrams because it includes information flow as well as material flow. Value-stream mapping is an overarching tool that gives managers and executives a picture of the entire production process, both value and non value-creating activities. Rather than taking a haphazard approach to lean implementation, value-stream mapping establishes a direction for the company.To encourage you to become actively involved in the learning process, Learning to See contains a case study based on a fictional company, Acme Stamping. You begin by mapping the current state of the value stream, looking for all the sources of waste. After identifying the waste, you draw a map of a leaner future state and a value-stream plan to guide implementation and review progress regularly.Written by two experts with practical experience, Mike Rother and John Shook, the workbook makes complicated concepts simple. It teaches you the reasons for introducing a mapping program and how it fits into a lean conversion.With this easy-to-use product, a company gets the tool it needs to understand and use value-stream mapping so it can eliminate waste in production processes. Start your lean transformation or accelerate your existing effort with value-stream mapping.

In general, a data stream is an unbounded data set that is produced incrementally over time, rather than being available in full before its processing begins. In this lecture, we give an overview of recent research in stream processing, ranging from answering simple queries on high-speed streams to loading real-time data feeds into a streaming warehouse for off-line analysis. We will discuss two types of systems for end-to-end stream processing: Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and Streaming Data Warehouses (SDWs). A traditional database management system typically processes a stream of ad-hoc queries over relatively static data. In contrast, a DSMS evaluates static (long-running) queries on streaming data, making a single pass over the data and using limited working memory. In the first part of this lecture, we will discuss research problems in DSMSs, such as continuous query languages, non-blocking query operators that continually react to new data, and continuous query optimization. The second part covers SDWs, which combine the real-time response of a DSMS by loading new data as soon as they arrive with a data warehouse''s ability to manage Terabytes of historical data on secondary storage.

After defining the key dimensions of a model for contextual processing, the book discusses how data is used to develop a semantic model for contexts as well as language-driven context-specific processing actions. It then applies rigorous mathematical methods to contexts, examines basic sensor data fusion theory and applies it to the contextual fusion of information, and describes the means to distribute contextual information. The authors also illustrate a new type of data repository model to manage contextual data, before concluding with the requirements of contextual security in a global environment. This seminal work presents an integrated framework for the design and operation of the next generation of IT processing.

insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('Open source software is changing the world of Information Technology. But making it work for your company is far more complicated than simply installing a copy of Linux. If you are serious about using open source to cut costs, accelerate development, and reduce vendor lock-in, you must institutionalize skills and create new ways of working. You must understand how open source is different from commercial software and what responsibilities and risks it brings. Open Source for the Enterprise is a sober guide to putting open source to work in the modern IT department. Open source software is software whose code is freely available to anyone who wants to change and redistribute it. New commercial support services, smaller licensing fees, increased collaboration, and a friendlier platform to sell products and services are just a few of the reasons open source is so attractive to IT departments. Some of the open source projects that are in current, widespread use in businesses large and small include Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JBOSS, and Perl. These have been used to such great effect by Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, and major commercial and financial firms, that a wave of publicity has resulted in recent years, bordering on hype. Large vendors such as IBM, Novell, and Hewlett Packard have made open source a lynchpin of their offerings. Open source has entered a new area where it is being used as a marketing device, a collaborative software development methodology, and a business model. This book provides something far more valuable than either the cheerleading or the fear-mongering one hears about open source. The authors are Dan Woods, former CTO of TheStreet.com and a consultant and author of several books about IT, and Gautam Guliani, Director of Software Architecture at Kaplan Test Prep & Admissions. Each has used open source software for some 15 years at IT departments large and small. They have collected the wisdom of a host of experts from IT departments, open source communities, and software companies. Open Source for the Enterprise provides a top to bottom view not only of the technology, but of the skills required to manage it and the organizational issues that must be addressed. Here are the sorts of questions answered in the book: Why is there a "productization gap" in most open source projects? How can the maturity of open source be evaluated? How can the ROI of open source be calculated? What skills are needed to use open source? What sorts of open source projects are appropriate for IT departments at the beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert levels? What questions need to be answered by an open source strategy? What policies for governance can be instituted to control the adoption of open source? What new commercial services can help manage the risks of open source? Do differences in open source licenses matter? How will using open source transform an IT department? Praise for Open Source for the Enterprise:"Open Source has become a strategic business issue; decisions on how andwhere to choose to use Open Source now have a major impact on theoverall direction of IT abilities to support the business both withcapabilities and by controlling costs. This is a new game and onegenerally not covered in existing books on Open Source which continue toassume that the readers are ''deep dive'' technologists, Open Source for the Enterprise provides everyone from business managers to technologistswith the balanced view that has been missing. Well worth the time toread, and also worth encouraging others in your enterprise to read as well." ----Andy Mulholland - Global CTO Capgemini "Open Source for the Enterprise is required reading for anyone workingwith or looking to adopt open source technologies in a corporateenvironment. Its practical, no-BS approach will make sure you''re armedwith the information you need to deploy applications successfully (aswell as helping you know when to say "no"). If you''re trying to sell opensource to management, this book will give you the ammunition you need.If you''re a manager trying to drive down cost using open source, thisbook will tell you what questions to ask your staff. In short, it''s aclear, concise explanation of how to successfully leverage open sourcewithout making the big mistakes that can get you fired." ----Kevin Bedell - founding editor of LinuxWorld Magazine', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-GmZBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Open Source for the Enterprise');

The first two chapters focus on practical considerations of cloud computing. In Chapter 1, Chandramouli, Iorga, and Chokani describe the evolution of cloud computing and the current state of practice, followed by the challenges of cryptographic key management in the cloud. In Chapter 2, Chen and Sion present a dollar cost model of cloud computing and explore the economic viability of cloud computing with and without security mechanisms involving cryptographic mechanisms. The next two chapters address security issues of the cloud infrastructure. In Chapter 3, Szefer and Lee describe a hardware-enhanced security architecture that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a virtual machine’s memory from an untrusted or malicious hypervisor. In Chapter 4, Tsugawa et al. discuss the security issues introduced when Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is deployed within and across clouds. Chapters 5-9 focus on the protection of data stored in the cloud. In Chapter 5, Wang et al. present two storage isolation schemes that enable cloud users with high security requirements to verify that their disk storage is isolated from some or all other users, without any cooperation from cloud service providers. In Chapter 6, De Capitani di Vimercati, Foresti, and Samarati describe emerging approaches for protecting data stored externally and for enforcing fine-grained and selective accesses on them, and illustrate how the combination of these approaches can introduce new privacy risks. In Chapter 7, Le, Kant, and Jajodia explore data access challenges in collaborative enterprise computing environments where multiple parties formulate their own authorization rules, and discuss the problems of rule consistency, enforcement, and dynamic updates. In Chapter 8, Smith et al. address key challenges to the practical realization of a system that supports query execution over remote encrypted data without exposing decryption keys or plaintext at the server. In Chapter 9, Sun et al. provide an overview of secure search techniques over encrypted data, and then elaborate on a scheme that can achieve privacy-preserving multi-keyword text search. The next three chapters focus on the secure deployment of computations to the cloud. In Chapter 10, Oktay el al. present a risk-based approach for workload partitioning in hybrid clouds that selectively outsources data and computation based on their level of sensitivity. The chapter also describes a vulnerability assessment framework for cloud computing environments. In Chapter 11, Albanese et al. present a solution for deploying a mission in the cloud while minimizing the mission’s exposure to known vulnerabilities, and a cost-effective approach to harden the computational resources selected to support the mission. In Chapter 12, Kontaxis et al. describe a system that generates computational decoys to introduce uncertainty and deceive adversaries as to which data and computation is legitimate. The last section of the book addresses issues related to security monitoring and system resilience. In Chapter 13, Zhou presents a secure, provenance-based capability that captures dependencies between system states, tracks state changes over time, and that answers attribution questions about the existence, or change, of a system’s state at a given time. In Chapter 14, Wu et al. present a monitoring capability for multicore architectures that runs monitoring threads concurrently with user or kernel code to constantly check for security violations. Finally, in Chapter 15, Hasan Cam describes how to manage the risk and resilience of cyber-physical systems by employing controllability and observability techniques for linear and non-linear systems.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwO9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Secure Cloud Computing');

insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('While the Internet revolution has vastly improved communication among businesses and individuals, pressure has been building for faster and less expensive broadband data services. Such services could not only yield vastly improved and less expensive provision of traditional applications such as voice telephony and Web browsing, but could also enable new applications such as Internet-based television, videoconferencing, and software distribution. However, broadband services and prices have not kept pace either with demand or with progress in information technology. This new book analyzes the markets and policy issues underlying the broadband dilemma. Charles Ferguson asserts that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and federal policy have failed to provide sufficient levels of new entry, competition, and innovation in the local telecommunications market, which remains dominated by monopoly telephone companies. New entrants and Internet-based firms such as competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), Internet service providers (ISPs), and enhanced service providers (ESPs) remain disadvantaged relative to the monopoly incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs). Flawed policy has also allowed ILECs to continue to engage in monopolistic practices, mergers, and anticompetitive conduct. Through a combination of inefficiency and rational monopolistic conduct, the ILECs are thus able to retard the deployment of new technology and services through delaying tactics, regulatory procedures, litigation, and political influence. Competition from the cable television (CATV) industry probably cannot fully address these problems. The CATV industry cannot compete in most business markets. In residential markets CATVs competitive potential is greater, but CATV vendors incentives to favor their own networks, services, and proprietary content raise major concerns analogous to those raised by the ILECs. The combined result of these market and policy failures is inadequate technological progress, innovation, and productivity growth in advanced Internet services and in telecommunications services generally. This significantly retards U.S. and global economic growth, perhaps by as much as one percent per year. Ferguson believes federal policy must be adjusted to ensure the robust infrastructure necessary for advanced Internet services, electronic commerce, open-systems HDTV, videoconferencing, and improved voice telephony. Ferguson recommends several policy changes, including increased regulatory surveillance of ILEC conduct, antitrust actions against ILECs, limits on conflicts of interest in government and academia, limits on CATV control of proprietary content, and possibly tax measures to stimulate construction of competitive', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Oh4j4V3ePlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Broadband Problem');

Companies, countries, and organizations the world over are waking up to today’s new reality. Women control the lion’s share of purchasing power and are increasingly essential to competitiveness. The age of women’s transformative economic influence has finally arrived, and women are using their power for purpose, redefining what power and success mean in the process. Through clear, practical advice and personal stories of women around the world — including Hillary Clinton, Geena Davis, Christine Lagarde, and Diane von Furstenberg — Fast Forward shows every woman how to know her power, find her purpose, and connect with others to achieve her life’s goals. www.senecawomen.com Advance praise for Fast Forward: "Fast Forward shows us how leaders at every level can use their power and purpose to help more and more women achieve their dreams for a better life." —Hillary Rodham Clinton "We are all capable of great things, even world-changing things, if we take inspiration from others and join together to get it done. We are witnessing an awakening to the justice of civil rights for women in our time. You can feel it is imminent, and it will change the world when it is accomplished. Here are stories of a few women who have dared to imagine the day, and worked to make it happen. Let them inspire you." —Meryl Streep, actor and activist “A life filled with purpose is the greatest gift we can give to ourselves - and to others. Fast Forward shows women how to lead lives of purpose and meaning, so that they, and our world, can thrive.” —Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief, Huffington Post “As I have travelled the world, I''ve seen the incredible strength and resilience of women everywhere, working at every level. If there was ever a doubt that our moment is now, this book dispels it. Fast Forward shows every woman how she can empower herself and her community, and why all of us will be better for it. Women are the growing force for progress in the 21st century.” —Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State "What is life without a sense of purpose? Any woman who''s asked herself this question must read Fast Forward, filled with inspiring stories of women who''ve achieved power in their own lives and used it to make a difference for others, especially other women and girls." —Maria Shriver, author and journalist "The stories in this inspirational book serve as a powerful reminder that, with the right support, women can become an unstoppable force in their communities and economies. It is a rousing call to action for anyone who cares about creating a more equal world. Unleashing the full potential of women is not an option - it is an imperative." —Cherie Blair, founder, Cherie Blair Foundation for Women "I love this book. It tells the stories of ingenious women who took the circumstances around them and created successful companies and purpose in their lives, while at the same time recognizing their own power to lift other women up, supporting both economic growth and social progress all over the world. It''s an inspiring wake-up call to action, and once you''re fired up, longing to find your own power and potential, it gives you a tool kit of information as to how you can begin. Brilliant." —Sally Field, actor and activist "Fast Forward gives all of us hope through the inspiring examples of pioneering women in global leadership, public service, and the corporate world - a path forged by Melanne Verveer since she helped Hillary Clinton transform the concept of women''s rights in Beijing in 1995. Verveer and co-author Kim Azzarelli share their practical experience with new insights into how we can all lean even further forward. A must read for women - and men - who believe strong, educated women and girls are the key to advancing societies." —Andrea Mitchell, Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent, NBC News “The stories of the remarkable women chronicled in Fast Forward are both inspiring and instructive, making it must-read for anyone interested in leading successfully with purpose in the 21st century. Fast Forward is also a reminder that progress and gender parity are inextricably linked and that if we want a society that operates at its best, we have to work for both.” —Ajay Banga, CEO, MasterCard “In Fast Forward, we are reminded why Melanne Verveer and Kim Azzarelli are two leading ''sheroes'' of the global women’s movement. The book is chock-full of wise and clever advice for women and men committed to empowering women to reach their full potential. You will be inspired by their profiles of determined women of resilience, grit and passion to change the world. Brava!” —Darren Walker, president, Ford Foundation “A durable contribution to the continued efforts to effect change for women.” —Kirkus Reviews “[An] empowering work about women’s valuable contributions to the global economy…An inspiring foreword by Hillary Clinton bolsters the authors’ message that women, working together, can accomplish anything.” —Publishers Weekly', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3CzUBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Fast Forward');

Distributed databases and the infrastructure needed to support them have been well studied. However, this book is the first to address distributed database interoperability by examining the successes and failures, various approaches, infrastructures, and trends of the field. A gap exists in the way that these systems have been investigated by real practitioners. This gap is more pronounced than usual, partly because of the way businesses operate, the systems they have, and the difficulties created by systems'' autonomy and heterogeneity. Telecommunications firms, for example, must deal with an increased demand for automation while at the same time continuing to function at their current level. While academics are focusing on investigating differences between distributed databases, federated databases, heterogeneous databases, and, more generally, among loosely connected and tightly coupled systems, those who have to deal with real problems right away know that the only relevant research is the one that will ensure that their system works to produce reasonably correct results. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems covers the underlying principles and infrastructures needed to realize truly global information systems. The book discusses technologies related to middleware, the Web, workflows, transactions, and data warehousing. It also overviews architectures with a discussion of critical issues. The book gives an overview of systems that can be viewed as learning platforms. While these systems do not translate to successful commercial realities, they push the envelope in terms of research. Successful commercial systems have benefited from the experiments conducted in these prototypes. The book includes two case studies based on the authors'' own work. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems is suitable as a textbook for a graduate-level course on Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems, as well as a secondary text for a graduate-level course on database or information systems, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wrrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems');

It is a story of hubris, greed, and betrayal - a tale more suited to Wall Street than the world''s top public university. Author John U. Bacon takes you inside the offices, the board rooms and the locker rooms of the University of Michigan to see what happened, and why - with countless eye-opening, head-shaking scenes of conflict and conquest. But Endzone is also an inspiring story of redemption and revival. When those who loved Michigan football the most recognized it was being attacked from within, they rallied to reclaim the values that made it great for over a century -- values that went deeper than dollars. The list of heroes includes players, students, lettermen, fans and faculty - and the leaders who had the courage to listen to them. Their unprecedented uprising produced a new athletic director, and a new coach - the hottest in the land - who vindicated the fans'' faith when he turned down more money and fame to return to the place he loved most: Michigan.

The University of Michigan has won more football games than any other Division I-A school, yet the program has only produced three Heisman Trophy winners and precious few winners of other individual awards. The numbers are understandable, however. The focus of Michigan football has always been on the team rather than the individual. "The Team, The Team, The Team" has for decades been one of the program''s best known mantras. No one player, not even someone worthy of the Heisman, is considered greater than anyone else. Team goals come first. Still, the storied history of the Michigan football program is composed mostly of the exploits of its players. While that history might start with the likes of Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard, and Charles Woodson, it does not end there. For every Heisman Trophy winner, there are hundreds of other players who helped to make the Michigan winged helmet the most recognized symbol in college football. Michigan: Where Have You Gone? offers a look at 50 of those other players. Some had a singular moment that would forever define their careers. Others played an exceptional game, in many cases against the Wolverines'' biggest rivals. Still others are remembered for a marvelous season.

Imaginative, narrative, dramatic, and lyrical creations that have Michigan settings, characters, subjects, and themes are organized into sixteen chapters on topics such as Indians in Michigan, settlers who came to Michigan, diversity in the state, the timber industry, the Great Lakes, crime in Michigan literature, Detroit, and Michigan poetry. In this most complete work to date, Clarence Andrews has assembled the literary reputation of a state. He illustrates, with a wide variety of literary works, that Michigan is more than just a builder of automobiles, a producer of apples and cherries, a supplier of copper and lumber, and the home of great athletes. It is also a state that has played—and continues to play—an important role in the production of American literature. To qualify for inclusion, a work or a significant part of it has to be set in Michigan. Andrews shows how novelists, dramatists, poets, and short story writers have created their particular images of Michigan by using and interpreting the history of the state—its land and waters, people, events, ideas, philosophies, and policies—sometimes factually, sometimes modified or distorted, and sometimes fancied or imagined. Biographical information is featured about authors, editors, and compilers, who range in fame from Ernest Hemingway and Elmore Leonard to persons long forgotten.

With the audacious belief that the lifestyles of the world''s Blue Zones could be adapted and replicated in towns across North America, Buettner launched the largest preventive health care project in the United States, The Blue Zones City Makeovers, which has impacted the health of millions of Americans since 2009. In The Blue Zones Solution, readers can be inspired by the specific stories of the people, foods, and routines of our healthy elders; understand the role community, family, and naturally healthy habits can play in improving our diet and health; and learn the exact foods—including the 50 superfoods of longevity and dozens of recipes adapted for Western tastes and markets—that offer delicious ways to eat your way to optimum health. Throughout the book are lifestyle recommendations, checklists, and stories to help you create your own personal Blue Zones solution. Readers will learn and apply the 80/20 rule, the plant slant diet, social aspects of eating that lead to weight loss and great health naturally, cultivating your "tribe" of friends and family, and your greater purpose as part of your daily routine.

In forty to-the-point, impressively erudite chapters drawing on the realms of history, child psychology, politics, and the environment, Maier effortlessly skewers the idealized notion of parenthood as a natural and beautiful endeavour. Enough with this “baby-mania” that is plaguing modern society, says Maier, it’s nothing but brainwashing.

In this provocative and engaging book, John Mueller argues that these mismatches between image and reality create significant political and economic problems--inspiring instability, inefficiency, and widespread cynicism. We would be far better off, he writes, if we recognized that neither system is ideal or disastrous and accepted instead the humdrum truth that both are "pretty good." And, to Mueller, that means good enough. He declares that what is true of Garrison Keillor''s fictional store "Ralph''s Pretty Good Grocery" is also true of democracy and capitalism: if you can''t get what you want there, "you can probably get along without it." Mueller begins by noting that capitalism is commonly thought to celebrate greed and to require discourtesy, deceit, and callousness. However, with examples that range from car dealerships and corporate boardrooms to the shop of an eighteenth-century silk merchant, Mueller shows that capitalism in fact tends to reward behavior that is honest, fair, civil, and compassionate. He argues that this gap between image and reality hampers economic development by encouraging people to behave dishonestly, unfairly, and discourteously to try to get ahead and to neglect the virtuous behavior that is an important source of efficiency and gain. The problem with democracy''s image, by contrast, is that our expectations are too high. We are too often led by theorists, reformers, and romantics to believe that democracy should consist of egalitarianism and avid civic participation. In fact, democracy will always be chaotic, unequal, and marked by apathy. It offers reasonable freedom and security, but not political paradise. To idealize democracy, Mueller writes, is to undermine it, since the inevitable contrast with reality creates public cynicism and can hamper democracy''s growth and development. Mueller presents these arguments with sophistication, wit, and erudition. He combines mastery of current political and economic literature with references to figures ranging from Plato to P. T. Barnum, from Immanuel Kant to Ronald Reagan, from Shakespeare to Frank Capra. Broad in scope and rich in detail, the book will provoke debate among economists, political scientists, and anyone interested in the problems (or non-problems) of modern democracy and capitalism.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MHCyoBveovcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Capitalism, Democracy, and Ralph''s Pretty Good Grocery');

Many grocery products are perishable and therefore time-sensitive in terms of their delivery needs.

This environment provides the opportunity to compare and select grocery products in unique and relevant ways in an information-rich environment. Consumers are embracing this online channel as a means of simplifying their lives and saving time. For researchers, online grocery shopping provides new research applications made possible from the unique ability to link longitudinal transactional data and survey-based attitudinal data at the individual household level. This means fast consumer feedback from a valuable sample, in a controlled environment, as well as the ability to monitor behaviour over time. Also, this environment can be a more efficient and cost-effective means of data collection and analysis than traditional survey research, in some instances.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wLDVV5wOZPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'E-Food and the Online Grocery Business');

Used in the exploration and discovery phase of a field, they are performed to determine the quality of a well or to permit estimation of producing rates at different producing pressures. However once a field enters the middle and later development phase, the reservoir flow environment grows increasingly complex and conventional or modern methods do not satisfy the needs of old field development and evaluation. Based on over 10 years of field and research experience, Streamline Numerical Well Test Interpretation Theory and Method provides an effective method for the determination of residual oil distribution for the middle and mature phases of a field. One of the most advanced books available, the author explains the development history of well test theory, analyzes the limitation of modern well test interpretation method, and proposes the concept and framework of numerical well test. This is quickly followed by an introduction of basic principles and solution procedures of streamline numerical simulation theory and method. The book then systematically applies streamline numerical well test interpretation models to a multitude of reservoir types, ranging from single layer reservoir to multi-layer reservoirs. The book presents multi-parameter streamline numerical well test automatic match interpretation method based on double-population genetic algorithm, which lays the foundation to fast automatic match of numerical well test. The book introduces streamline numerical well test interpretation software with independent intellectual property right which is programmed based on the above theoretical studies.

Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1dE_AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The App Generation');

When experienced parents decide to adopt an older child or a sibling group, they jump through all kinds of bureaucratic hoops â?? background checks, interviews, group meetings, reading assignments, classes, etc. But most often the typically developing children these adults are already parenting (whether through birth or adoption) are left out of the process, informed that a new kid is coming, and simply expected to â??adjustâ?? to the addition of another sibling. The addition of a child with a history of neglect or trauma cannot be a seamless transition. The expectations of everyone involved â?? parents, new siblings, and, yes, professionals facilitating the adoption â?? must be realistic, taking into account that the new child will need special attention that may take away time and attention from the already resident kids, that family life is likely to be turned topsy turvy until appropriate counseling and support are in place, that relationships will change. Therapist Arleta James is certainly not the first person to recognize this, but she is the first to do something about it.

Based on a person-centered collaborative approach, with patients as partners, this method builds on a cooperative and empathic team effort involving prescribers, therapists, patients, and their families or support network.

This book provides critical information about when to consider psychiatric drug reduction or withdrawal, and how to accomplish it as safely, expeditiously, and comfortably as possible. It offers the theoretical framework underlying this approach along with extensive scientific information, practical advice, and illustrative case studies that will assist practitioners in multiple ways, including in how to: Recognize common and sometimes overlooked adverse drug effects that may require withdrawal Treat emergencies during drug therapy and during withdrawal Determine the first drugs to withdraw during multi-drug therapy Distinguish between withdrawal reactions, newly occurring emotional problems, and recurrence of premedication issues Estimate the length of withdrawal', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYzZa42DYw4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal');

But Diego Cordovez and Selig S. Harrison shatter this image. Out of Afghanistan shows that the Red Army was securely entrenched when the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw: American weaponry and Afghan bravery raised the costs for Moscow, but it was six years of skillful diplomacy that gave the Russians a way out. Cordovez and Harrison provide the definitive account of the Soviet blunders that led up to the invasion and the bitter struggles over the withdrawal that raged in the Soviet and Afghan Communist parties and the Reagan Administration. The authors are particularly well-suited to their task: Cordovez was the United Nations mediator who negotiated the Soviet pullout, and Harrison is a leading South Asia expert with four decades of experience in covering Afghanistan. Their story of the U.N. negotiations is interwoven with a gripping chronicle of the war years, complete with palace shootouts in Kabul, turf warfare between rival Soviet intelligence agencies, and the CIA role in building up Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla leaders at the expense of Afghan moderates. Cordovez opens up his diaries to take us behind the scenes in his negotiations, and Harrison draws on interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and other key actors. The result is a book full of surprises. For example, the authors demonstrate that the Soviets intervened not out of a desire to drive to the Indian Ocean, but out of a fear of a U.S.-supported Afghan Tito. Rebuffs by hardline "bleeders" in the Reagan Administration undermined efforts by Yuri Andropov to secure a settlement before his death in 1983. Even more startling, Gorbachev resumed the search for a negotiated withdrawal more than a year before the first American-supplied Stinger missiles were deployed in the war. The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was one of the pivotal events of recent history. Out of Afghanistan destroys many of the myths surrounding the Afghan war and will have a profound impact on the emerging debate over how and why the Cold War ended.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iFasqHGo3p0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Out of Afghanistan');

In Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal, Shannon L. Mariotti explores Thoreau’s nature writings to offer a new way of understanding the unique politics of the so-called hermit of Walden Pond. Drawing imaginatively from the twentieth-century German social theorist Theodor W. Adorno, she shows how withdrawal from the public sphere can paradoxically be a valuable part of democratic politics. Separated by time, space, and context, Thoreau and Adorno share a common belief that critical inquiry is essential to democracy but threatened by modern society. While walking, huckleberrying, and picking wild apples, Thoreau tries to recover the capacities for independent perception and thought that are blunted by “Main Street,” conventional society, and the rapidly industrializing world that surrounded him. Adorno’s thoughts on particularity and the microscopic gaze he employs to work against the alienated experience of modernity help us better understand the value of Thoreau’s excursions into nature. Reading Thoreau with Adorno, we see how periodic withdrawals from public spaces are not necessarily apolitical or apathetic but can revitalize our capacity for the critical thought that truly defines democracy. In graceful, readable prose, Mariotti reintroduces us to a celebrated American thinker, offers new insights on Adorno, and highlights the striking common ground they share. Their provocative and challenging ideas, she shows, still hold lessons on how we can be responsible citizens in a society that often discourages original, critical analysis of public issues.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NdLfcuEeA6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal');

The awkward reality is that an Iraqi-U.S. failure to properly manage the U.S. withdrawal and the creation of effective Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) is as serious a threat to Iraq''s future stability and security as any internal or external threat. Realism is a key to future success. The improvement in ISF capabilities is very real, and Iraqi forces are experiencing growing success in combat. But they are still very much a work in progress, and many Iraqi and U.S. politicians still seem unaware of how much remains to be done. U.S. forces play a critical role in developing the effectiveness of the ISF, providing stability in areas with deep sectarian and ethnic tensions and helping Iraq achieve political accommodation and more effective governance.Through detailed analyses of Iraqi force capabilities, augmented by on-site interviews with U.S. and Iraqi military officials, the authors conclude that the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq needs to be “conditions-based,” not tied to political timelines. Both Iraqi and U.S. leaders need to be careful about exaggerating Iraqi capabilities and the speed with which the United States can safely withdraw its forces and advisory teams. Conditions for success include realistic and fully resourced plans for the ISF''s development; candid and accurate measures of ISF capabilities; and careful assessments of the overall level of security, stability, and political accommodation in Iraq.After years of destructive conflict, Iraq now has the chance, however tenuous, to become a stable and prosperous country. The United States, say the authors, will be judged far more by the way it leaves Iraq and what it leaves behind than by the way it entered and how it fought the counterinsurgency campaign.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6oP3Y9ZM3sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Withdrawal from Iraq');

PCI Compliance: The Definitive Guide explains the ins and outs of the payment card industry (PCI) security standards in a manner that is easy to understand. This step-by-step guidebook delves into PCI standards from an implementation standpoint. It begins with a basic introduction to PCI compliance, including its history and evolution. It then thoroughly and methodically examines the specific requirements of PCI compliance. PCI requirements are presented along with notes and assessment techniques for auditors and assessors. The text outlines application development and implementation strategies for Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) implementation and validation. Explaining the PCI standards from an implementation standpoint, it clarifies the intent of the standards on key issues and challenges that entities must overcome in their quest to meet compliance requirements. The book goes beyond detailing the requirements of the PCI standards to delve into the multiple implementation strategies available for achieving PCI compliance. The book includes a special appendix on the recently released PCI-DSS v 3.0. It also contains case studies from a variety of industries undergoing compliance, including banking, retail, outsourcing, software development, and processors. Outlining solutions extracted from successful real-world PCI implementations, the book ends with a discussion of PA-DSS standards and validation requirements.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OF_NBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'PCI Compliance');

Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol highlights two long-term processes in the monetary and economic negotiations in the decade leading up to the founding of the EMS in 1979. The first is a transnational learning process involving a powerful, networked European monetary elite that shaped a habit of cooperation among technocrats. The second stresses the importance of the European Council, which held regular meetings between heads of government beginning in 1974, giving EEC legitimacy to monetary initiatives that had previously involved semisecret and bilateral negotiations. The interaction of these two features changed the EMS from a fairly trivial piece of administrative business to a tremendously important political agreement. The inception of the EMS was greeted as one of the landmark achievements of regional cooperation, a major leap forward in the creation of a unified Europe. Yet Mourlon-Druol''s account stresses that the EMS is much more than a success story of financial cooperation. The technical suggestions made by its architects reveal how state elites conceptualized the larger project of integration. And their monetary policy became a marker for the conception of European identity. The unveiling of the EMS, Mourlon-Druol concludes, represented the convergence of material interests and symbolic, identity-based concerns.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7FW0dcsVvooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Europe Made of Money');

That’s because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts so we sound smart and in control and so we fit into society.

Freewriting is deceptively simple: start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor won’t be able to keep up with your output—you’ll generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldn’t have created any other way. Levy shares his six secrets to freewriting as well as fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepower—seven of which are new to this edition.

Although much attention has been paid to the new technologies making this possible, from digitized books to sensor networks, it is the underlying social and policy changes that will have the most lasting effect on the scholarly enterprise. In Scholarship in the Digital Age, Christine Borgman explores the technical, social, legal, and economic aspects of the kind of infrastructure that we should be building for scholarly research in the twenty-first century.Borgman describes the roles that information technology plays at every stage in the life cycle of a research project and contrasts these new capabilities with the relatively stable system of scholarly communication, which remains based on publishing in journals, books, and conference proceedings. No framework for the impending "data deluge" exists comparable to that for publishing. Analyzing scholarly practices in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, Borgman compares each discipline''s approach to infrastructure issues. In the process, she challenges the many stakeholders in the scholarly infrastructure -- scholars, publishers, libraries, funding agencies, and others -- to look beyond their own domains to address the interaction of technical, legal, economic, social, political, and disciplinary concerns.

With the audacious belief that the lifestyles of the world''s Blue Zones could be adapted and replicated in towns across North America, Buettner launched the largest preventive health care project in the United States, The Blue Zones City Makeovers, which has impacted the health of millions of Americans since 2009. In The Blue Zones Solution, readers can be inspired by the specific stories of the people, foods, and routines of our healthy elders; understand the role community, family, and naturally healthy habits can play in improving our diet and health; and learn the exact foods—including the 50 superfoods of longevity and dozens of recipes adapted for Western tastes and markets—that offer delicious ways to eat your way to optimum health. Throughout the book are lifestyle recommendations, checklists, and stories to help you create your own personal Blue Zones solution. Readers will learn and apply the 80/20 rule, the plant slant diet, social aspects of eating that lead to weight loss and great health naturally, cultivating your "tribe" of friends and family, and your greater purpose as part of your daily routine.

Part I focuses on optimal control and scheduling of discrete-time switched linear systems. The objective is to simultaneously design a control law and a switching (scheduling) law such that a cost function is minimized. This optimization problem exhibits exponential complexity. Taming the complexity is a major challenge. Two novel methods are presented to approach this optimization problem: Receding-horizon control and scheduling relies on the receding horizon principle. The optimization problem is solved based on relaxed dynamic programming, allowing to reduce complexity by relaxing optimality within predefined bounds. The solution can be expressed as a piecewise linear (PWL) state feedback control law. Stability is addressed via an a priori stability condition based on a terminal weighting matrix and several a posteriori stability criteria based on constructing piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions and on utilizing the cost function as a candidate Lyapunov function. Moreover, a region-reachability criterion is derived. Periodic control and scheduling relies on periodic control theory. Both offline and online scheduling are studied. The optimization problem is solved based on periodic control and exhaustive search. The online scheduling solution can again be expressed as a PWL state feedback control law. Stability is guaranteed inherently. Several methods are proposed to reduce the online complexity based on relaxation and heuristics. Part II focuses on optimal control and scheduling of NECSs. The NECS is modeled as a block-diagonal discrete-time switched linear system. Various control and scheduling codesign strategies are derived based on the methods from Part I regarding the structural properties of NECSs. The methods presented in Part I and II are finally evaluated in a case study.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4yiSjtcD-JEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Optimal Control of Switched Systems with Application to Networked Embedded Control Systems');

Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of the The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systemsArthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that "It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance."Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with "built-in" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text.After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations.This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities.

The conferences were founded, and led ten times, by Professor Bittner (Greifswald) and Professor KlCitzler (Leipzig), who both celebrated their 65th birthdays in 1996. The 12th conference in Trassenheide, was, therefore, also dedicated to L. Bittner and R. Klotzler. Both scientists made a lasting impression on control theory in the former GDR. Originally, the conferences served to promote the exchange of research results. In the first years, most of the lectures were theoretical, but in the last few conferences practical applications have been given more attention. Besides their pioneering theoretical works, both honorees have also always dealt with applications problems. L. Bittner has, for example, examined optimal control of nuclear reactors and associated safety aspects. Since 1992 he has been working on applications in optimal control in flight dynamics. R.

Drama had been forgotten since the days of ancient Greece, but it reemerged in Elizabethan London with the building of the first modern theater. Its impact can still be imagined today. There were the theaters, open to the weather and featuring neither sets nor curtains, but equipped with dramatic special effects. There were the companies of actors--the leading men, the comedians, the boys who played women''s roles--and the playwrights who gave them all lines to say. Best of all, there was William Shakespeare, who rubbed shoulders with noblemen and royalty as well as with the rowdy crowds at the foot of the stage. He was suspected of involvement in a treasonous rebellion, and his last play literally brought down the house when cannon effects set fire to the famous Globe theater and it burned to the ground. Award-winning collaborators Diane Stanley and Peter Vennema have once again created a feast of words and pictures to celebrate the life of a remarkable person from the pages of history: William Shakespeare, a man for all time."', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lMnSnJMgFUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Bard of Avon');

Amy Edmondson shows that organizations thrive, or fail to thrive, based on how well the small groups within those organizations work. In most organizations, the work that produces value for customers is carried out by teams, and increasingly, by flexible team-like entities. The pace of change and the fluidity of most work structures means that it''s not really about creating effective teams anymore, but instead about leading effective teaming. Teaming shows that organizations learn when the flexible, fluid collaborations they encompass are able to learn. The problem is teams, and other dynamic groups, don''t learn naturally. Edmondson outlines the factors that prevent them from doing so, such as interpersonal fear, irrational beliefs about failure, groupthink, problematic power dynamics, and information hoarding. With Teaming, leaders can shape these factors by encouraging reflection, creating psychological safety, and overcoming defensive interpersonal dynamics that inhibit the sharing of ideas. Further, they can use practical management strategies to help organizations realize the benefits inherent in both success and failure. Presents a clear explanation of practical management concepts for increasing learning capability for business results Introduces a framework that clarifies how learning processes must be altered for different kinds of work Explains how Collaborative Learning works, and gives tips for how to do it well Includes case-study research on Intermountain healthcare, Prudential, GM, Toyota, IDEO, the IRS, and both Cincinnati and Minneapolis Children''s Hospitals, among others Based on years of research, this book shows how leaders can make organizational learning happen by building teams that learn.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wlnsR9i9b5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Teaming');

Currently, a broad spectrum of data related to protein functionality in food systems has been collected, however, much more needs to be known. In this volume, the most important functional properties offood proteins are presented: Protein solubility, water holding capacity and fat binding, emulsifying, foaming, and gelling properties as affected by protein source, environmental factors (pH, temperature, ionic strength) and protein concentration; Relationships between protein conformation, physicochemical properties, and functional properties; Protein functional properties as influenced by various food processing conditions, particularly heat treatment, dehydration, freezing and storage when frozen, extraction and other processes; Effects ofprotein modification on the enhancementofprotein functionality; Utilization ofvarious proteins in improving functional properties in food systems. Those aspects of protein functionality are presented which the author believes to be interesting and most important for protein utilization in food systems.

High atop the Rhode Island capitol in Providence, a bronze likeness of "The Independent Man" keeps watch over a state that historically has put the ideal of individual liberty before all others. Like many ideals, this one was freighted with many meanings. As the colony grew in the seventeenth century, the belief in religious liberty and freedom of conscience espoused by its founder, Roger Williams, led to the development of political liberty and practical democracy. In the eighteenth century, that dedication to individualism made Rhode Islanders into businessmen of the first order, willing to take the big risk in hope of a bigger reward. Their land being poor in natural resources, Rhode Islanders turned to trade; accumulating wealth from traffic in rum and slaves, they built in Newport and Providence small but elegant copies of Georgian England, and worried more about taxes and currency than about religion. When they felt poorly served by British policies, they became ready revolutionaries and led in the founding of a new nation. After the Civil War, their children took individual liberty to mean economic laissez-faire, ushering in the state''s golden age when Rhode Island senator Nelson Aldrich became known as the "general manager" of the United States. Through countless changes in the twentieth century, the ideal still survives and asks old questions of new generations of Rhode Islanders from many ethnic backgrounds: How best to reconcile the rights of minorities with the rule of the majority, and how best to secure the individual liberty and economic opportunity that Roger Williams and Moses Brown would have understood so well?', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5Z3UNxHdT0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Rhode Island: A History (States and the Nation)');

But, in reality, immigrants often feel pressured to create a singular formulation of their identity that does not reflect the diversity of cultures that exist in their homeland. Hindu Americans have faced this challenge over the last fifteen years, as the number of Indians that have immigrated to this country has more than doubled. In A Place at the Multicultural Table, Prema A. Kurien shows how various Hindu American organizations--religious, cultural, and political--are attempting to answer the puzzling questions of identity outside their homeland. Drawing on the experiences of both immigrant and American-born Hindu Americans, Kurien demonstrates how religious ideas and practices are being imported, exported, and reshaped in the process. The result of this transnational movement is an American Hinduism--an organized, politicized, and standardized version of that which is found in India. This first in-depth look at Hinduism in the United States and the Hindu Indian American community helps readers to understand the private devotions, practices, and beliefs of Hindu Indian Americans as well as their political mobilization and activism. It explains the differences between immigrant and American-born Hindu Americans, how both understand their religion and their identity, and it emphasizes the importance of the social and cultural context of the United States in influencing the development of an American Hinduism.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ONMxZc5_saYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Place at the Multicultural Table');

The complicated tensions between the identity of a city and the character of a university can challenge both communities. Lexington, Kentucky, displays these characteristic conflicts, with two historic educational institutions within its city limits: Transylvania University, the first college west of the Allegheny Mountains, and the University of Kentucky, formerly “State College.” An investigative cultural history of the town that called itself “The Athens of the West,” Taking the Town: Collegiate and Community Culture in Lexington, Kentucky, 1880–1917 depicts the origins and development of this relationship at the turn of the twentieth century. Lexington’s location in the upper South makes it a rich region for examination. Despite a history of turmoil and violence, Lexington’s universities serve as catalysts for change. Until the publication of this book, Lexington was still characterized by academic interpretations that largely consider Southern intellectual life an oxymoron. Kolan Thomas Morelock illuminates how intellectual life flourished in Lexington from the period following Reconstruction to the nation’s entry into the First World War. Drawing from local newspapers and other primary sources from around the region, Morelock offers a comprehensive look at early town-gown dynamics in a city of contradictions. He illuminates Lexington’s identity by investigating the lives of some influential personalities from the era, including Margaret Preston and Joseph Tanner. Focusing on literary societies and dramatic clubs, the author inspects the impact of social and educational university organizations on the town’s popular culture from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era. Morelock’s work is an enlightening analysis of the intersection between student and citizen intellectual life in the Bluegrass city during an era of profound change and progress. Taking the Town explores an overlooked aspect of Lexington’s history during a time in which the city was establishing its cultural and intellectual identity.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Lac2FUSj_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Kentucky Place Names');

In Spain, his works were regularly read, quoted, and referenced, at least until the nineteenth century, when literary critics and philosophers wrote him out of the history of early modern Spain. In Ficino in Spain, Susan Byrne uses textual and bibliographic evidence to show the pervasive impact of Ficino''s writings and translations on the Spanish Renaissance. Cataloguing everything from specific mentions of his name in major texts to glossed volumes of his works in Spanish libraries, Byrne shows that Spanish writers such as Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Bartolomé de las Casas, and Garcilaso de la Vega all responded to Ficino and adapted his imagery for their own works. An important contribution to the study of Spanish literature and culture from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries, Ficino in Spain recovers the role that Hermetic and Neoplatonic thought played in the world of Spanish literature.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mX1kCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Ficino in Spain');

Military rule has suffocated civil society and has entrenched a culture of repression, corruption, and official irresponsibility. The reign of Ibrahim Babangida has resulted in near total economic disaster for the country. The situation is so bad, as Julius Ihonvbere shows, that Nigerians are now saying that the days of colonialism were better. In this major new study, Ihonvbere searches out the sources of Nigeria''s predicament. He finds them in the country''s historical experience, and the consequences of that experience since gaining political independence. Nigeria has become a society in which its citizens live in fear and its youth emigrate to other countries. It is now impossible to survive in the country without belonging to a certain religion, living in a particular region, having connections with top military officers, and being involved with some form of corruption. Even involvement in drug pushing or extrajudicial murder is no longer considered a crime, but a circumstance of life. Such conditions have encouraged the emergence of several popular organizations. New alliances of students, workers, women, youths, intellectuals, professionals, and the unemployed transcend ethnic, regional, and religious differences. For the author, it is at this emerging level of struggle and interaction that the future of Nigeria lies. This work examines several critical, but often overlooked or underresearched aspects of Nigeria''s political economy. Ihonvbere analyzes in detail Nigeria''s foreign policy, its economic crisis, the military, the decay of its educational system, and democratization. He pays particular attention to the paradoxical connection between IMF/World Bank-supervised structural adjustment and the struggle for democracy. His book will be of interest to experts hi socioeconomic development, foreign policy analysts, students of military science, and scholars of African politics and history.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qIZK-rZtjIIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Nigeria');

Data from this exploratory research study indicates that digital learning objects shift the focus of education from the instructor to the learner. Participants talked and wrote about students'' active engagement in their learning with instructors as facilitators providing scaffolding and support for student learning. Interactive digital learning objects providing immediate feedback opportunities allowed students to control the learning pace, manipulate and extend learning in new ways that are difficult to find in other learning activities. Models and visualizations extended and enriched learning, making abstract concepts more concrete by providing multiple perspectives that provoke learner reflection and restructuring of their knowledge leading to higher levels of learning. Digital learning objects were used to motivate students by gaining their attention, providing relevant content, encouraging learner confidence, and gaining learner satisfaction.

In War, Technology, and Experience aboard the USS Monitor, David A. Mindell adds a new perspective to the story as he explores how mariners—fighting "blindly" below the waterline—lived and coped with the metal monster they called the "iron coffin." Mindell shows how the iron warship emerged as an idea and became practicable, how building it drew upon and forced changes in contemporary manufacturing technology, and how the vessel captured the nineteenth-century American popular and literary imaginations. Combining technical, personal, administrative, and literary analysis, Mindell examines the experience of the men aboard the Monitor and their reactions to the thrills and dangers that accompanied the new machine. The invention surrounded men with iron and threatened their heroism, their self-image as warriors, even their lives. Mindell also examines responses to this strange new warship by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, who prophetically saw in the Civil War a portent of the mechanized warfare of the future. The story of the Monitor shows how technology changes not only the tools but also the very experience of combat, generating effects that are still felt today in the era of "smart bombs" and pushbutton wars. "We find new significance in the otherwise well-known history of the Monitor. It is no longer the story of the heroic inventor and his impenetrable weapon thrusting themselves upon a doubtful and conservative bureaucracy... It is no longer the story of a heroic battle and the machine''s epic loss soon after. Rather it is a story of people experiencing new machinery, attempting to make sense of its thrills, constrictions, and politics, and sensing its power and impotence—both in glory and frustration."—from War, Technology, and Experience aboard the USS Monitor', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8E6ug5RcKT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'War, Technology, and Experience Aboard the USS Monitor');

We walk on it, drive on it, and many of us live and work within its walls. But very few of us know what it is. We take for granted this ubiquitous substance, which both literally and figuratively comprises much of modern civilization’s constructed environment; yet the story of its creation and development features a cast of fascinating characters and remarkable historical episodes. This book delves into this history, opening readers’ eyes at every turn. In a lively narrative peppered with intriguing details, author Robert Corland describes how some of the most famous personalities of history became involved in the development and use of concrete—including King Herod the Great of Judea, the Roman emperor Hadrian, Thomas Edison (who once owned the largest concrete cement plant in the world), and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Courland points to recent archaeological evidence suggesting that the discovery of concrete directly led to the Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the earliest civilizations. Much later, the Romans reached extraordinarily high standards for concrete production, showcasing their achievement in iconic buildings like the Coliseum and the Pantheon. Amazingly, with the fall of the Roman Empire, the secrets of concrete manufacturing were lost for over a millennium. The author explains that when concrete was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century it was initially viewed as an interesting novelty or, at best, a specialized building material suitable only for a narrow range of applications. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that the use of concrete exploded. During this rapid expansion, industry lobbyists tried to disguise the fact that modern concrete had certain defects and critical shortcomings. It is now recognized that modern concrete, unlike its Roman predecessor, gradually disintegrates with age. Compounding this problem is another distressing fact: the manufacture of concrete cement is a major contributor to global warming. Concrete Planet is filled with incredible stories, fascinating characters, surprising facts, and an array of intriguing insights into the building material that forms the basis of the infrastructure on which we depend.

Focusing on structurally innovative vaulting and the factors that influenced its advancement, Lynne Lancaster also explores a range of related practices, including lightweight pumice as aggregate, amphoras in vaults, vaulting ribs, metal tie bars, and various techniques of buttressing. She provides the geological background of the local building stones and applies mineralogical analysis to determine material provenance, which in turn suggests trading patterns and land use. Lancaster also examines construction techniques in relation to the social, economic, and political contexts of Rome, in an effort to draw connections between changes in the building industry and the events that shaped Roman society from the early empire to late antiquity.

Wiseman Book Award from the Archaeological Institute of America in 2007.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsuQIZUDv7sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome');

Yet he grew up to become the greatest English-speaking playwright in the world. Bard of Avon: The Story of William Shakespeare is both his story and that of a great art rediscovered in the modern world. Drama had been forgotten since the days of ancient Greece, but it reemerged in Elizabethan London with the building of the first modern theater. Its impact can still be imagined today. There were the theaters, open to the weather and featuring neither sets nor curtains, but equipped with dramatic special effects. There were the companies of actors--the leading men, the comedians, the boys who played women''s roles--and the playwrights who gave them all lines to say. Best of all, there was William Shakespeare, who rubbed shoulders with noblemen and royalty as well as with the rowdy crowds at the foot of the stage. He was suspected of involvement in a treasonous rebellion, and his last play literally brought down the house when cannon effects set fire to the famous Globe theater and it burned to the ground.
